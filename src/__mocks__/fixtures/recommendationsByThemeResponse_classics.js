        "In 1942, the launch of&#160;<b>Little Golden Books</b>&#160;revolutionized children&rsquo;s book publishing by making high-quality picture books available at affordable prices. More than 60 years later, many of the original Golden Book titles are still wildly popular, with <i>The Poky Little Puppy</i> topping the list of ten bestselling children&rsquo;s books of all time.&#160;Golden Books&rsquo; backlist is teeming with classics such as Dorothy Kunhardt&rsquo;s<i> Pat the Bunny</i>, and features the stories and artwork of children&rsquo;s book legends Mary Blair, Margaret Wise Brown, Richard Scarry, Eloise Wilkins, Garth Williams, and many more.&#160;Today, the Golden Books imprint includes an array of storybooks, novelty books, and coloring and activity books featuring all of the most popular licenses, including Disney, Nickelodeon, Barbie, Thomas &amp; Friends, The Cat in the Hat, Sesame Street, Marvel Super Heroes, and DC Super Friends. Golden Books&#160;continues to reissue the best of its backlist in a variety of formats, including ebooks and apps, as well as bringing out brand-new books in these evolving new formats.<br><br><b>Byron Jackson </b>(1899&ndash;1949), along with his wife Kathryn Jackson, wrote hundreds of classic and well-known&#160;stories, poems, and books for Golden Books, including <i>The Saggy Baggy Elephant, Tawny Scrawny Lion,</i> and<i> A Day at the Seashore.</i><br><br><b>Gustaf Tenggren&#160;</b>(1896&ndash;1970) was a well-known illustrator in his native Sweden before immigrating to the United States in 1920. He illustrated many Golden Books, beginning with&#160;<i>The Poky Little Puppy.&#160;</i>One of the original twelve Little Golden Books&#160;published in 1942,&#160;<i>The Poky Little Puppy&#160;</i>went on to become the bestselling picture book of all time. Other iconic Little Golden Books illustrated by Tenggren include&#160;<i>The Saggy Baggy Elephant&#160;</i>and&#160;<i>Tawny Scrawny Lion.&#160;</i>In the late 1930s, Tenggren worked for the Disney Studio, providing concept artwork (created to inspire and guide animators) for various characters and scenes in&#160;<i>Bambi, The Old Mill, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio,&#160;</i>and&#160;<i>Fantasia.</i>",

        "In 1942, the launch of&#160;<b>Little Golden Books</b>&#160;revolutionized children&rsquo;s book publishing by making high-quality picture books available at affordable prices. More than 60 years later, many of the original Golden Book titles are still wildly popular, with <i>The Poky Little Puppy</i> topping the list of ten bestselling children&rsquo;s books of all time.&#160;Golden Books&rsquo; backlist is teeming with classics such as Dorothy Kunhardt&rsquo;s<i> Pat the Bunny</i>, and features the stories and artwork of children&rsquo;s book legends Mary Blair, Margaret Wise Brown, Richard Scarry, Eloise Wilkins, Garth Williams, and many more.&#160;Today, the Golden Books imprint includes an array of storybooks, novelty books, and coloring and activity books featuring all of the most popular licenses, including Disney, Nickelodeon, Barbie, Thomas &amp; Friends, The Cat in the Hat, Sesame Street, Marvel Super Heroes, and DC Super Friends. Golden Books&#160;continues to reissue the best of its backlist in a variety of formats, including ebooks and apps, as well as bringing out brand-new books in these evolving new formats.<br><br><b>Gustaf Tenggren&#160;</b>(1896&ndash;1970) was a well-known illustrator in his native Sweden before immigrating to the United States in 1920. He illustrated many Golden Books, beginning with&#160;<i>The Poky Little Puppy.&#160;</i>One of the original twelve Little Golden Books&#160;published in 1942,&#160;<i>The Poky Little Puppy&#160;</i>went on to become the bestselling picture book of all time. Other iconic Little Golden Books illustrated by Tenggren include&#160;<i>The Saggy Baggy Elephant&#160;</i>and&#160;<i>Tawny Scrawny Lion.&#160;</i>In the late 1930s, Tenggren worked for the Disney Studio, providing concept artwork (created to inspire and guide animators) for various characters and scenes in&#160;<i>Bambi, The Old Mill, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio,&#160;</i>and&#160;<i>Fantasia.</i>",

      excerpt:
        "CHAPTER 1<br><br>Harriet was trying to explain to Sport how to play Town. &ldquo;See, first you make up the name of the town. Then you write down the names of all the people who live in it. You can&rsquo;t have too many or it gets too hard. I usually have twenty-five.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Ummmm.&rdquo; Sport was tossing a football in the air. They were in the courtyard of Harriet&rsquo;s house on East Eighty-seventh Street in Manhattan.<br><br>&ldquo;Then when you know who lives there, you make up what they do. For instance, Mr. Charles Hanley runs the filling station on the corner.&rdquo; Harriet spoke thoughtfully as she squatted next to the big tree, bending so low over her notebook that her long straight hair touched the edges.<br><br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;tcha wanta play football?&rdquo; Sport asked.<br><br>&ldquo;Now, listen, Sport, you never did this and it&rsquo;s fun. Now over here next to this curve in the mountain we&rsquo;ll put the filling station. So if anything happens there, you remember where it is.&rdquo;<br><br>Sport tucked the football under his arm and walked over to her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing but an old tree root. Whaddya mean, a mountain?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a mountain. From now on that&rsquo;s a mountain. Got it?&rdquo; Harriet looked up into his face.<br><br>Sport moved back a pace. &ldquo;Looks like an old tree root,&rdquo; he muttered.<br><br>Harriet pushed her hair back and looked at him seriously. &ldquo;Sport, what are you going to be when you grow up?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;You know what. You know I&rsquo;m going to be a ball player.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to be a writer. And when I say that&rsquo;s a mountain, that&rsquo;s a mountain.&rdquo; Satisfied, she turned back to her town.<br><br>Sport put the football gently on the ground and knelt beside her, looking over her shoulder at the notebook in which she scribbled furiously.<br><br>&ldquo;Now, as soon as you&rsquo;ve got all the men&rsquo;s names down, and their wives&rsquo; names and their children&rsquo;s names, then you figure out all their professions. You&rsquo;ve got to have a doctor, a lawyer--&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;And an Indian chief,&rdquo; Sport interrupted.<br><br>&ldquo;No. Someone who works in television.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What makes you think they have television?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I say they do. And, anyway, my father has to be in it, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Well, then put mine in too. Put a writer in it.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Okay, we can make Mr. Jonathan Fishbein a writer.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;And let him have a son like me who cooks for him.&rdquo; Sport rocked back and forth on his heels, chanting in singsong, &ldquo;And let him be eleven years old like me, and let him have a mother who went away and has all the money, and let him grow up to be a ball player.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Nooo,&rdquo; Harriet said in disgust. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not making it up. Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;<br><br>Sport paused. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.<br><br>&ldquo;Just listen, Sport. See, now that we have all this written down, I&rsquo;ll show you where the fun is.&rdquo; Harriet got very businesslike. She stood up, then got on her knees in the soft September mud so she could lean over the little valley made between the two big roots of the tree. She referred to her notebook every now and then, but for the most part she stared intently at the mossy lowlands which made her town. &ldquo;Now, one night, late at night, Mr. Charles Hanley is in his filling station. He is just about to turn out the lights and go home because it is nine o&rsquo;clock and time for him to get ready for bed.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s a grown-up!&rdquo; Sport looked intently at the spot occupied by the gas station.<br><br>&ldquo;In this town everybody goes to bed at nine-thirty,&rdquo; Harriet said definitely.<br><br>&ldquo;Oh&rdquo;--Sport rocked a little on his heels--&ldquo;my father goes to bed at nine in the morning. Sometimes I meet him getting up.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;And also, Dr. Jones is delivering a baby to Mrs. Harrison right over here in the hospital. Here is the hospital, the Carterville General Hospital.&rdquo; She pointed to the other side of town. Sport looked at the left root.<br><br>&ldquo;What is Mr. Fishbein, the writer, doing?&rdquo;<br><br>Harriet pointed to the center of town. &ldquo;He is in the town bar, which is right here.&rdquo; Harriet looked down at the town as though hypnotized. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what happens. Now, this night, as Mr. Hanley is just about to close up, a long, big old black car drives up and in it there are all these men with guns. They drive in real fast and Mr. Hanley gets scared. They jump out of the car and run over and rob Mr. Hanley, who is petrified. They steal all the money in the gas station, then they fill up with gas free and then they zoom off in the night. Mr. Hanley is all bound and gagged on the floor.&rdquo;<br><br>Sport&rsquo;s mouth hung open. &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;At this same minute Mrs. Harrison&rsquo;s baby is born and Dr. Jones says, &lsquo;You have a fine baby girl, Mrs. Harrison, a fine baby girl, ho, ho, ho.&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Make it a boy.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a girl. She already has a boy.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What does the baby look like?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ugly. Now, also at this very minute, on the other side of town, over here past the gas station, almost to the mountain, the robbers have stopped at a farmhouse which belongs to Ole Farmer Dodge. They go in and find him eating oatmeal because he doesn&rsquo;t have any teeth. They throw the oatmeal on the floor and demand some other food. He doesn&rsquo;t have anything but oatmeal, so they beat him up. Then they settle down to spend the night. Now, at this very minute, the police chief of Carterville, who is called Chief Herbert, takes a stroll down the main street. He senses something is not right and he wonders what it is. . . .&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Harriet. Get up out of that mud.&rdquo; A harsh voice rang out from the third floor of the brownstone behind them.<br><br>Harriet looked up. There was a hint of anxiety in her face. &ldquo;Oh, Ole Golly, I&rsquo;m not in the mud.&rdquo;<br><br>The face of the nurse looking out of the window was not the best-looking face in the world, but for all its frowning, its sharp, dark lines, there was kindness there. &ldquo;Harriet M. Welsch, you are to rise to your feet.&rdquo;<br><br>Harriet rose without hesitation. &ldquo;But, listen, we&rsquo;ll have to play Town standing up,&rdquo; she said plaintively.<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best way&rdquo; came back sharply, and the head disappeared.<br><br>Sport stood up too. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we play football, then?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;No, look, if I just sit like this I won&rsquo;t be in the mud.&rdquo; So saying, she squatted on her heels next to the town. &ldquo;Now, he senses that there is something wrong--&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;How can he? He hasn&rsquo;t seen anything and it&rsquo;s all on the other side of town.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;He just feels it. He&rsquo;s a very good police chief.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Sport said dubiously.<br><br>&ldquo;So, since he&rsquo;s the only policeman in town, he goes around and deputizes everybody and he says to them, &lsquo;Something is fishy in this here town. I feel it in my bones,&rsquo; and everybody follows him and they get on their horses--&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Horses!&rdquo; Sport shrieked.<br><br>&ldquo;They get in the squad car and they drive around town until--&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Harriet.&rdquo; The back door slammed and Ole Golly marched squarely toward them across the yard. Her long black shoes made a slap-slap noise on the brick.<br><br>&ldquo;Hey, where are you going?&rdquo; asked Harriet, jumping up. Because Ole Golly had on her outdoor things. Ole Golly just had indoor things and outdoor things. She never wore anything as recognizable as a skirt, a jacket, or a sweater. She just had yards and yards of tweed which enveloped her like a lot of discarded blankets, which ballooned out when she walked, and which she referred to as her Things.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you somewhere. It&rsquo;s time you began to see the world. You&rsquo;re eleven years old and it&rsquo;s time you saw something.&rdquo; She stood there above them, so tall that when they looked up they saw the blue sky behind her head.<br><br>Harriet felt a twinge of guilt because she had seen a lot more than Ole Golly thought she had. But all she said was &ldquo;Oh, boy,&rdquo; and jumped up and down.<br><br>&ldquo;Get your coat and hurry. We&rsquo;re leaving right now.&rdquo; Ole Golly always did everything right now. &ldquo;Come on, Sport, it won&rsquo;t hurt you to look around too.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I have to be back at seven to cook dinner.&rdquo; Sport jumped up as he said this.<br><br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back long before that. Harriet and I eat at six. Why do you eat so late?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;He has cocktails first. I have olives and peanuts.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice. Now go get your coats.&rdquo;<br><br>Sport and Harriet ran through the back door, slamming it behind them.<br><br>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the noise?&rdquo; spluttered the cook, who whirled around just in time to see them fly through the kitchen door and up the back stairs. Harriet&rsquo;s room was at the top of the house, so they had three flights to run up and they were breathless by the time they got there.<br><br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;re we going?&rdquo; Sport shouted after Harriet&rsquo;s flying feet.<br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Harriet panted as they entered her room, &ldquo;but Ole Golly always has good places.&rdquo;<br><br>Sport grabbed his coat and was out the door and halfway down the steps when Harriet said, &ldquo;Wait, wait, I can&rsquo;t find my notebook.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Oh, whadya need that for?&rdquo; Sport yelled from the steps.<br><br>&ldquo;I never go anywhere without it,&rdquo; came the muffled answer.<br><br>&ldquo;Aw, come on, Harriet.&rdquo; There were great crashing noises coming from the bedroom. &ldquo;Harriet? Did you fall down?&rdquo;<br><br>A muffled but very relieved voice came out. &ldquo;I found it. It must have slipped behind the bed.&rdquo; And Harriet emerged clutching a green composition book.<br><br>&ldquo;You must have a hundred of them now,&rdquo; Sport said as they went down the steps.<br><br>&ldquo;No, I have fourteen. This is number fifteen. How could I have a hundred? I&rsquo;ve only been working since I was eight, and I&rsquo;m only eleven now. I wouldn&rsquo;t even have this many except at first I wrote so big my regular route took almost the whole book.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;You see the same people every day?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes. This year I have the Dei Santi family, Little Joe Curry, the Robinsons, Harrison Withers, and a new one, Mrs. Plumber. Mrs. Plumber is the hardest because I have to get in the dumbwaiter.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Can I go with you sometime?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;No, silly. Spies don&rsquo;t go with friends. Anyway, we&rsquo;d get caught if there were two of us. Why don&rsquo;t you get your own route?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Sometimes I watch out my window a window across the way.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What happens there?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Nothing. A man comes home and pulls the shade down.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very exciting.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;It sure isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br><br>They met Ole Golly waiting for them, tapping her foot, outside the front door. They walked to Eighty-sixth Street, took the crosstown bus, and soon were whizzing along in the subway, sitting in a line--Ole Golly, then Harriet, then Sport. Ole Golly stared straight ahead. Harriet was scribbling furiously in her notebook.<br><br>&ldquo;What are you writing?&rdquo; Sport asked.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking notes on all those people who are sitting over there.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Aw, Sport&rdquo;--Harriet was exasperated--&ldquo;because I&rsquo;ve seen them and I want to remember them.&rdquo; She turned back to her book and continued her notes:<br><br>MAN WITH ROLLED WHITE SOCKS, FAT LEGS. WOMAN WITH ONE CROSS-EYE AND A LONG NOSE. HORRIBLE -LOOKING LITTLE BOY AND A FAT BLONDE MOTHER WHO KEEPS WIPING HIS NOSE OFF. FUNNY LADY LOOKS LIKE A TEACHER AND IS READING. I DON&rsquo;T THINK I&rsquo;D LIKE TO LIVE WHERE ANY OF THESE PEOPLE LIVE OR DO THE THINGS THEY DO. I BET THAT LITTLE BOY IS SAD AND CRIES A LOT. I BET THAT LADY WITH THE CROSS-EYE LOOKS IN THE MIRROR AND JUST FEELS TERRIBLE.<br><br>Ole Golly leaned over and spoke to them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to Far Rockaway. It&rsquo;s about three stops from here. I want you to see how this person lives, Harriet. This is my family.&rdquo;<br><br>Harriet almost gasped. She looked up at Ole Golly in astonishment, but Ole Golly just stared out the window again. Harriet continued to write:<br><br>THIS IS INCREDIBLE. COULD OLE GOLLY HAVE A FAMILY? I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT. HOW COULD OLE GOLLY HAVE A MOTHER AND FATHER? SHE&rsquo;S TOO OLD FOR ONE THING AND SHE&rsquo;S NEVER SAID ONE WORD ABOUT THEM AND I&rsquo;VE KNOWN HER SINCE I WAS BORN. ALSO SHE DOESN&rsquo;T GET ANY LETTERS. THINK ABOUT THIS. THIS MIGHT BE IMPORTANT.<br><br>They came to their stop and Ole Golly led them off the subway.<br><br>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Sport as they came up onto the sidewalk, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re near the ocean.&rdquo; And they could smell it, the salt, and even a wild soft spray which blew gently across their faces, then was gone.<br><br>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ole Golly briskly. Harriet could see a change in her. She walked faster and held her head higher.<br><br>They were walking down a street that led to the water. The houses, set back from the sidewalk with a patch of green in front, were built of yellow brick interspersed with red. It wasn&rsquo;t very pretty, Harriet thought, but maybe they liked their houses this way, better than those plain red brick ones in New York.<br><br>Ole Golly was walking faster and looking sterner. She looked as though she wished she hadn&rsquo;t come. Abruptly she turned in at a sidewalk leading to a house. She strode relentlessly up the steps, never looking back, never saying a word. Sport and Harriet followed, wide-eyed, up the steps to the front door, through the front hall, and out the back door.<br><br>She&rsquo;s lost her mind, Harriet thought. She and Sport looked at each other with raised eyebrows. Then they saw that Ole Golly was heading for a small private house which sat in its own garden behind the apartment house. Harriet and Sport stood still, not knowing what to do. This little house was like a house in the country, the kind Harriet saw when she went to Water Mill in the summer. The unpainted front had the same soft gray of driftwood, the roof a darker gray.<br><br>&ldquo;Come on, chickens, let&rsquo;s get us a hot cup of tea.&rdquo; Ole Golly, suddenly gay, waved from the funny little rotting porch.<br><br>Harriet and Sport ran toward the house, but stopped cold when the front door opened with a loud swish. There, suddenly, was the largest woman Harriet had ever seen.<br><br>&ldquo;Why, lookahere what&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; she bellowed, &ldquo;looka them lil rascals,&rdquo; and her great fat face crinkled into large cheerful lumps as her mouth split to show a toothless grin. She let forth a high burbling laugh.<br><br>Sport and Harriet stood staring, their mouths open. The fat lady stood like a mountain, her hands on her hips, in a flowered cotton print dress and enormous hanging coat sweater. Probably the biggest sweater in the world, thought Harriet; probably the biggest pair of shoes too. And her shoes were a wonder. Long, long, black, bumpy things with high, laced sides up to the middle of the shin, bulging with the effort of holding in those ankles, their laces splitting them into grins against the white of the socks below. Harriet fairly itched to takes notes on her.",

      excerpt:
        "The gray gelding, Napoleon, was built from the ground up and butter fat. His roundness was not due to overfeeding or lack of exercise but to a most placid disposition and an ease of adapting himself to any kind of situation or way of life. He stood with one hind foot drawn in an easy, relaxed position and eyes half-closed. Only his long ears moved, and they just wobbled as if the weight of them was too much for him to bear at this particular moment. He was the picture of contentment; as peaceful as the June night which enveloped him. There was no reason for him to appear otherwise. He was perfectly happy with his life.<br><br> The grass of his paddock moved in the night breeze, giving it the soft, liquid motion of the sea. There were stars and a moon, and together they shone frostlike on the fences and roofs of the barns and main house a short distance away.<br><br> Finally the old gray roused himself to saunter about his paddock. His movements were slow and quiet. He was very particular in his choice of grass. He would stop only long enough to crop a few mouthfuls, then go on to other grasses that appealed more to his fancy and discriminating taste. But it wasn't long before he returned to his favorite haunt beneath the billowing oak tree. He closed his eyes again.<br><br> All was quiet, and as it should be. The inky silhouette of a tall, black stallion moved in the adjacent paddock to his left. Teeth clicked sharply as the stallion cut the grass low and even.<br><br> The gray's wobbling ears were keen, and by using them he followed the movements of the Black. He was well aware, too, of the whereabouts of the burly black horse in still another paddock, the one on his right. He had heard Satan snort a few moments ago.<br><br> The breeze became stronger, gently whipping his body with a shower of deep evening coolness. After the heat of day it felt very good. That there were no flies to bother him added to his enjoyment. For ideal comfort this was the way it should be. A fly-protected barn during the day, and at night the freedom of the paddocks. For several weeks now the horses had been allowed this privilege. It would continue as long as there was peace in the paddocks. All this the old gray knew very well; his vast experience told him so.<br><br> He knew why he occupied the paddock between the Black and Satan. To keep his head, to think for himself, to do what was expected of him . . . these things he had learned long ago. He did his duties willingly, whether he was on the track, helping to school young and eager yearlings in their first lessons, or here in the paddock, where he was ever watchful of the actions of mature stallions. Knowing that he was wanted, that he had a job to do, gave him a warm consciousness of virtue and well-being. He opened his eyes, took in the paddock fences, and then, as though receiving comfort and security from their great height, permitted his eyelids to drop again. This time he went fast asleep.<br><br> He awakened to the sound of a strong wind. The skies had turned black. The moon was blanketed by heavy, running clouds and the stars were mere pinpoints in the heavens, shedding no light below. The oak tree afforded the gray horse protection against the wind and he was loath to leave it. Besides, there was no reason for him to go. He need only stay here and wait out the wind. If it got worse and became a storm, he was certain that soon he would see the lights go on in the house and barn, and shortly thereafter he and the others would be taken into their stalls. He moved closer to the great trunk of the tree, and for a while just listened to the racing winds above him.<br><br> It was the wind and the blackness of the night that diverted Napoleon's attention from the movements of the tall stallion in the next paddock. For a long while the Black had trotted lightly and warily along the fence, only his eyes disclosing the excitement that burned within him. He made no sound except for the slight, hushed beat of his hoofs over the grass. He did not shrill his challenge to the burly stallion two paddocks away from him. It was not yet time. The Black was clever and able to control the savage instinct that sought release within his great body.<br><br> The wind whipped his mane, and his tail, set high, billowed behind him. He stopped again to measure the height of the fence. In spite of his long limbs he had to stretch his head to touch the top board. He moved on to the front corner of the paddock, facing the barn. Once more he tested his strength against the center boards at this particular spot. They bent as they had before. He pushed harder this time. They cracked and split. He stopped using his strength, waiting almost cunningly until deciding on his next move. The fire in his eyes was mounting.<br><br> Carefully he lowered himself to the ground, pressing the weight of his body against the bottom board. Then he rolled away and struck a smashing blow against it with his hind feet. It split as had the others. Still on his back, he rolled back and forth, using his great body like a pendulum against the boards. But he did not ram his weight like a blundering bruiser. Instead, with cunning and skill he maneuvered his body, using pressure against the split boards only when he knew they were most apt to give completely. Finally they broke and were swept outward as he rolled under the top board. The Black was free of his confining paddock!",

      excerpt:
        "Homeward Bound<br><br>1<br><br>The tramp steamer Drake plowed away from the coast of India and pushed its blunt prow into the Arabian Sea, homeward bound. Slowly it made its way west toward the Gulf of Aden. Its hold was loaded with coffee, rice, tea, oil seeds and jute. Black smoke poured from its one stack, darkening the hot cloudless sky.<br><br>Alexander Ramsay, known to his friends back home in New York City as Alec, leaned over the rail and watched the water slide away from the sides of the boat. His red hair blazed redder than ever in the hot sun; his tanned elbows rested heavily on the rail as he turned his freckled face back toward the fast-disappearing shore.<br><br>It had been fun--those two months in India. He would miss Uncle Ralph, miss the days they had spent together in the jungle, even the screams of the panthers and the many eerie sounds of the jungle night. Never again would he think of a missionary's work as easy work. No, sir, you had to be big and strong, able to ride horseback for long hours through the tangled jungle paths. Alec glanced down proudly at the hard muscles in his arms. Uncle Ralph had taught him how to ride--the one thing in the world he had always wanted to do.<br><br>But it was all over now. Rides back home would be few.<br><br>His fist opened. Lovingly he surveyed the pearl pocketknife he held there. The inscription on it was in gold: To Alec on his birthday, Bombay, India. He remembered, too, his uncle's words: &quot;A knife, Alec, comes in handy sometimes.&quot;<br><br>Suddenly a large hand descended on his shoulder. &quot;Well, m'boy, you're on your way home,&quot; a gruff voice said, with a decidedly English accent.<br><br>Alec looked up into the captain's wrinkled, wind-tanned face. &quot;Hello, Captain Watson,&quot; he answered. &quot;It's rather a long way home, though, sir. To England with you and then to New York on the Majestic.&quot;<br><br>&quot;About four weeks' sailing all in all, lad, but you look like a pretty good sailor.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am, sir. I wasn't sick once all the way over and we had a rough crossing, too,&quot; Alec said proudly.<br><br>&quot;When'd you come over, lad?&quot;<br><br>&quot;In June, sir, with some friends of my father's. They left me with my uncle in Bombay. You know my Uncle Ralph, don't you? He came aboard with me and spoke to you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, I know your Uncle Ralph. A fine man, too. . . . And now you're going home alone?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, sir! School opens next month and I have to be there.&quot;<br><br>The captain smiled and took Alec by the arm. &quot;Come along,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll show you how we steer this ship and what makes it go.&quot;<br><br>The captain and crew were kind to Alec, but the days passed monotonously for the homeward-bound boy as the Drake steamed its way through the Gulf of Aden and into the Red Sea. The tropic sun beat down mercilessly on the heads of the few passengers aboard.<br><br>The Drake kept near the coast of Arabia--endless miles of barren desert shore. But Alec's thoughts were not on the scorching sand. Arabia--where the greatest horses in the world were bred! Did other fellows dream of horses the way he did? To him, a horse was the greatest animal in the world.<br><br>Then one day the Drake headed for a small Arabian port. As they approached the small landing, Alec saw a crowd of Arabs milling about in great excitement. Obviously it was not often that a boat stopped there.<br><br>But, as the gangplank went down with a bang, Alec could see that it wasn't the ship itself that was attracting all the attention. The Arabs were crowding toward the center of the landing. Alec heard a whistle--shrill, loud, clear, unlike anything he had ever heard before. He saw a mighty black horse rear on its hind legs, its forelegs striking out into the air. A white scarf was tied across its eyes. The crowd broke and ran.<br><br>White lather ran from the horse's body; his mouth was open, his teeth bared. He was a giant of a horse, glistening black--too big to be pure Arabian. His mane was like a crest, mounting, then falling low. His neck was long and slender, and arched to the small, savagely beautiful head. The head was that of the wildest of all wild creatures--a stallion born wild--and it was beautiful, savage, splendid. A stallion with a wonderful physical perfection that matched his savage, ruthless spirit.<br><br>Once again the Black screamed and rose on his hind legs. Alec could hardly believe his eyes and ears--a stallion, a wild stallion--unbroken, such as he had read and dreamed about!",

      excerpt:
        'Night hung black and heavy about the old barn. An iron gate creaked a short distance away and a few minutes later the short figure of a man slid alongside the barn. As he moved cautiously forward his fat, gloved hand felt the wood. The man stopped as he neared the door and his hand dug into his right coat pocket. Fumbling, he searched for something. Not finding it, he uttered an oath and reached awkwardly across to his left-hand pocket. He pulled the empty sleeve from the pocket and reached inside, withdrawing a long hypodermic needle. His dark-skinned face creased into folds of fatty tissue as he smiled. Moving forward once again, he did not bother to replace the empty coat sleeve and it hung limply at his side in the still air.<br><br> The prowler reached the door. Carefully he opened it and slid inside. His eyes, already accustomed to the darkness, made out the stalls on the other side of the barn. As he moved toward them, his thumb slipped to the back of the hypodermic needle.<br><br> The hard ring of a horse\'s hoofs against the floor came from one of the stalls. Then a long and slender neck that arched to a small, savagely beautiful head peered over the door. Thin-skinned nostrils quivered as black ears pitched forward. The prowler, halfway to the stall door, had stopped. The horse shook his long black mane and a powerful foreleg struck the door.<br><br> A board creaked as the man moved closer. Baring his teeth, the horse whistled the shrill, loud scream of a wild stallion. As the whistle resounded through the barn, the prowler moved forward. He would have to work fast. Mincing steps carried his round body to the stall door with amazing speed. He opened it, but fell back as the black stallion struck at him.<br><br> Gripping the hypodermic firmly, the prowler advanced again, more cautiously this time. He stopped and his fat face twitched nervously. The giant horse rose on his hind legs, mouth open and teeth bared. As he came down, the man lunged at him, but the horse\'s foreleg caught him in the groin. The attacker turned gray beneath his bronze skin. Staggering back, he attempted to close the stall door behind him. The stallion, halfway through the door, rose again on his hind legs as the man stumbled and fell to the floor. Thrashing hoofs pawed the air above him. The hypodermic dropped from his hand as the giant form began to descend. The man rolled fast, avoiding the stallion\'s hoofs by inches. Climbing to his feet, he ran frantically for the barn door.<br><br> Outside, he heard voices coming from the direction of the gate and, turning, stumbled off into the night, the empty coat sleeve waving slightly at his side.<br><br> A few minutes later a young boy, carrying a flashlight, ran up to the barn door. Following him was a bowlegged man who moved with jerky strides.<br><br> "Something must be wrong, Henry," the youth shouted. "The door\'s open!"<br><br> Henry grabbed the flashlight. "Yeah, I\'ll go in, Alec. Y\'stay here, just in case . . ."<br><br> Impatiently, Alec waited while Henry entered the barn. A hand swept nervously across his pug nose as he pinched his nostrils. There was a worried expression on his freckled face. If anything had happened to the Black! Then he heard the short neigh and the sound of the stallion\'s hoofs against the floor. His tense body relaxed. Everything was probably all right. Looking around the yard, his gaze swept to the open field. It was getting light and already he could make out the high white fence at the north end. There was no one around. He tightened the belt holding up his corduroys and then pushed a hand through his red, tousled hair.<br><br> Turning on the lights, Henry appeared in the doorway. He beckoned Alec inside.<br><br> The Black was in his stall. He whistled softly when he saw Alec and shook his black mane, which mounted high, then fell low, like a crest.<br><br> "Find anything, Henry?"<br><br> "He was out of his stall. Someone\'s been here . . . there\'s been a fight of some kind. He\'s sweated." Henry ran a gnarled hand over the stallion\'s body as it glistened in the bright light.<br><br> The Black moved nervously around his stall and didn\'t quiet until Alec\'s hand rested on the thin-skinned nostrils. "He seems to be okay though, Henry."<br><br> "Yep." Henry was quiet. In his hand he studied a long glass object wrapped in his handkerchief.<br><br> "What is it?" Alec asked.<br><br> "A hypo."<br><br> "You mean a hypodermic needle?" Alec asked incredulously. "You found it here?"<br><br> "Yep . . . on the floor."<br><br> "What\'s it mean, Henry?" Alec moved away from the Black to get a closer view of the glass tube.<br><br> "Looks as if someone intended to use it on the Black."<br><br> "Y\'mean . . ." Alec\'s heart thumped hard. "Henry, are you sure it hasn\'t been used?"<br><br> "It\'s filled. We\'ll get the stuff analyzed today by the police and find out what it is. Maybe it\'ll give us a clue of some kind." He wrapped the needle in the handkerchief and said, "Also, there might be some fingerprints. . . ."<br><br> Alec moved over to the Black again. The stallion lowered his head and, rubbing it, Alec asked, "But why would anyone want to harm him, Henry?"<br><br> "Your guess is as good as mine, Alec." Then Henry added, ". . . perhaps better."<br><br> "What do you mean?"<br><br> Henry moved over to Alec and placed a long arm on the stall door. "Well, here\'s how I figure it out. The Black is a valuable horse since he beat out Sun Raider and Cyclone last June. There\'s no doubt that he\'s the fastest thing to set foot on any track here or abroad. Now to my way of thinkin\' there\'s a good many reasons why somebody would want to steal the Black. He couldn\'t be raced but he could be used for stud . . . that horse could do much to improve the bloodline of the American thoroughbred. . . ."',

      excerpt:
        'The man was almost invisible against the backdrop of the dark velvet curtain. His tall figure was clothed completely in black and his hair and skin were black as well. He raised a large and corded hand, one capable of great strength, to touch the silver-gray body of the mare beside him. His hand was so light upon her that he might have been touching a ghost.<br><br> She responded to his touch by a slight fluttering of her ears. It was enough for him to know that she was expectant and ready to enter the ring. He parted the stage curtain a bit in order to see the spacious hall and audience on the other side.<br><br> It was his first visit to Stockholm, Sweden, and he was impressed. The hall was more like a theater than quarters for a circus. Festively illuminated, it was a pleasing sight on that bitter-cold winter night. Red plush seats in ringside boxes and rear and side balconies rose to what seemed an incredible height. Every place was taken and all eyes were on the single ring where Davisio Castini and his bareback riding troupe were bringing their act to its finale.<br><br> The orchestra played a stirring march while the heavy horses thumped about the ring. The type did not appeal to him but he knew they had a place in the circus. He cared less for the feathered head plumes and jewel-studded breast collars they wore.<br><br> He touched his mare again and her ears pricked forward, awaiting his spoken command. There never would be any glittering ornaments on her, he promised himself. No plumes. No jewel-studded bridles. No colorful ribbons woven into her mane or tail. Nothing, not even a halter. By her movements alone she would overwhelm the audience.<br><br> He pressed closer against the curtain to avoid being seen. No emotion showed on his face; never had he allowed it to betray his feelings, in or out of the ring. Cold and masklike, and with deep-set unblinking black eyes, it resembled a piece of classic sculpture. Always he had sensed people\'s fear of him and, while he found it amusing, never attempted to change it.<br><br> The bareback act came to an end and there was a fanfare of drums from the orchestra, followed by a polite wave of applause from the large crowd. He listened and decided that, despite the air of festivity, the audience was as cold as the night outside.<br><br> Nervously, now that it was almost time for his mare to enter the ring, he removed a small gold figurine from his pocket and rubbed it gently. The growing warmth of the statuette in his large black hands gave him courage and confidence. He believed strongly in the powers of the small figurine, for his Haitian blood and heritage had made him more superstitious than most men.<br><br> The ringmaster, wearing frock coat and top hat, signaled him to be ready. "Bientot, ma cherie," he said quietly to his mare.<br><br> The fanfare of the trumpets cut the air once more. Then the shrill notes ended and the voice of the ringmaster rang through the spacious hall, as clear and commanding as the silver trumpets had been.<br><br> "Ladies and gentlemen and children," the ringmaster announced in Swedish, "the Circus Heyer takes great pleasure in presenting The Ghost. . . ."<br><br> As the horseman listened to the introduction, he thought of the great number of languages in which he had heard it given. For more than ten years he had traveled with different circuses throughout Europe, as far east as Siberia as well as to all the British Isles.<br><br> He knew little Swedish, but it made no difference, since the introduction was always the same. Like the music which would follow, he had composed it himself, so he and his mare always felt at home in whatever country they played.<br><br> There was a long pause as the lights in the great hall dimmed until the audience sat in almost complete darkness. This, too, he insisted upon wherever he played--ten seconds, at the very minimum, to silence the spectators and prepare them for the ethereal beauty of what was to come.<br><br> He slipped the thin leather halter off the mare\'s head, acutely aware of her readiness to obey every cue. He had no doubt that she looked forward to the gala stage on the other side of the curtain and the elegant audience that would be watching her.<br><br> The ringmaster had moved to the orchestra pit, leaving the ring in total darkness. "The Ghost," his introduction continued, "a god-horse, one no longer earthbound but of dancing fire, a winged Pegasus . . ."<br><br> The man holding the mare would have preferred it if the introduction had ended there. He wanted nothing more except complete silence and the darkness, followed by the first haunting notes of the music. However, the owner of the Circus Heyer, like most of the others he had worked for, insisted that his name be mentioned, since it was familiar to circus audiences throughout the world. He had given up arguing that it was only the mare\'s performance that mattered.<br><br> ". . . A supreme exhibition of horse training directed by the world\'s first horseman in the art of dressage and haute ecole, Captain Philippe de Pluminel, formerly with the Cadre Noir of the French Cavalry School!"<br><br> "Entrez," the captain whispered softly to the mare. She went forward while he remained behind the curtain, his face showing no trace of nervousness or even excitement. He was a man in full command of himself and the horse in the ring.<br><br> Into the complete darkness and the silence came the first sounds of the music. It was faint, almost impossible to hear, and then it swelled, flowing throughout the hall. The captain could sense the rise in tension as the people waited for something to happen. They were under the spell of darkness and expectation.<br><br> He knew that few among them realized that his music had been composed to create just that feeling--that anything might happen. It faded away again to the faintest of sounds and, finally, stopped as abruptly as it had begun.<br><br> The captain smiled in the darkness. The audience was still silent, but he knew that they were growing apprehensive. They must be straining their eyes and ears for the faintest sound or movement from the ring.',

But when he got to eighty-six Miss Kelly called, &#8220;Andrew&#8230; are you paying attention?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Yes, Miss Kelly,&#8221; Andrew said.<br> &#8220;Good, Andrew. I&#8217;m glad to hear that. Now will you please pick up your chair and your reading goup? We&#8217;re all waiting for you.&#8221;<br>Andrew stood up in a hurry. His reading group giggled. Especially Sharon. He couldn&#8217;t stand that Sharon. She thought she knew everything! He picked up his chair and carried it to the corner where his reading group sat.<br>&#8220;You may begin, Andrew,&#8221; Miss Kelly said. &#8220;Page sixty-four.&#8221;<br>Andrew turned the pages in his book. Sixty-four&#8230;sixty-four. He couldn&#8217;t find it. The pages stuck together. Why did Miss Kelly have to pick him?<br>Everybody else already had their books opened to the right page.<br>Sharon kept giggling. She covered her mouth to keep in the noise, but Andrew knew what was going on. He finally found page sixty-four. Right where it was supposed to be&#8230;between pages sixty-three and sixty-five. If he had his own freckles he wouldn&#8217;t have to count Nicky Lane&#8217;s. Then he&#8217;d here Miss Kelly when she called reading groups. And nobody would laugh at him.<br>Later, when the bell rang, Andrew poked Nicky Lane. <br>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; Nicky asked, turning around. &#8220;I was wondering about your freckles,&#8221; Andrew said.<br>&#8220;Oh yeah? What about them?&#8221;<br>Andrew felt pretty stupid. &#8220;Well, how did you get them?&#8221;<br>&#8220;What do you mean <i>how</i>? You get <i>born</i> with them. That&#8217;s how!&#8221;<br>Andrew thought that&#8217;s what Nicky would say.<br>Some help <i>he</i> was!<br>&#8220;Line up, boys and girls,&#8221; Miss Kelly said. &#8220;Time to go home now. Sharon, you may lead the girls. Andrew, you may lead the boys.&#8221;<br>Some luck! Just when he got to be leader he had to stand next to <i>Sharon</i>!<br>When they were in line Sharon whispered to Andrew. &#8220;Psst&#8230; I know how to get them.&#8221;<br>&#8220;How to get what?&#8221; Andrew asked.<br>&#8220;Freckles,&#8221; Sharon said.<br>&#8220;Who asked <i>you</i>?&#8221;<br>&#8220;I heard you ask Nicky about his.&#8221; Sharon ran her tongue along her teeth. She was always doing that.<br>&#8220;Do you want to know how to get them?&#8221; Sharon asked.<br>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; Andrew told her.<br>&#8220;It&#8217;ll cost you fifty cents. I have a secret recipe for freckle juice,&#8221; Sharon whispered.<br>&#8220;A secret recipe?&#8221; <br>&#8220;Uh-huh.&#8221;<br>Sharon&#8217;s tongue reminded Andrew of a frog catching flies. He wondered if Sharon ever got a mouthful of bugs the way she opened her mouth and wiggled her tongue around. Andrew inspected Sharon&#8217;s face.<br>&#8220;You don&#8217;t even have freckles!&#8221; he said.<br>&#8220;Look close,&#8221; Sharon said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got six on my nose.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Big deal! A lot of good six will do.&#8221;<br>&#8220;You can get as many as you want. Six was enough for me. It all depend on how much freckle juice you drink.&#8221;<br>Andrew didn&#8217;t believe Sharon for a minute. Not one minute! There was no such thing as freckle juice. Andrew had never heard of it before!",

      authorweb: "Robert Cormier",
      authqanda:
        "<i>The following introduction to </i>The Chocolate War <i>was written by Robert Cormier in 1997.<br><br>The Chocolate War</i> was written during weekday evening hours and Saturday mornings in parts of 1969, 1970, and 1971 while I was working full-time as a newspaper editor and columnist.<br><br>Writing the novel was a labor of love. Although the setting was a Catholic boys&#8217; high school, I regarded the school as a metaphor for the world. On the other hand, I knew that, on its primary level, this was a story about a school chocolate sale. Who would be interested in reading such a story? I sometimes wondered. Yet I was having such a good time as the words leaped and danced on the page and the characters of Jerry Renault, Archie Costello, and Brother Leon came alive that I didn&#8217;t worry about it. <br><br>It seems incredible to me that more than two decades later, <i>The Chocolate War</i> continues to be read and taught (and to cause problems) in classrooms here in the United States and in such places as England, Australia, Sweden, France, and Japan, among others.<br><br>Yet the novel was almost stillborn and existed for more than a year in a kind of literary no-man&#8217;s-land. Seven major publishers rejected it over the course of thirteen months in 1972 and 1973. The reasons? Too complicated. Too many characters. A downbeat ending, which teenagers of the 1970s would find difficult to accept. Too violent. Not quite an adult novel, too sophisticated to be a juvenile novel. Too unbelievable. That frustrating &#8220;Not for us,&#8221; without further comment. One publisher, however, seriously considered accepting it if some changes were made, particularly to the ending.<br><br>I decided not to change or revise the novel. This was not a heroic gesture but an act of innocence. I knew nothing of the young adult market, was unaware of its then traditions and taboos, the domination of &#8220;safe&#8221; stories with role-model heroes walking off into the sunset of happy endings.<br><br>Although <i>The Chocolate War</i> does not have that hoped-for happy ending, its history has had happy moments and its share of heroes.<br><br>My son, Peter, inspired the novel when he refused, as a matter of principle, to sell the chocolates at his school&#8217;s annual sale.<br><br>Marilyn E. Marlow, my literary agent at Curtis Brown Ltd., supported my decision against revisions and insisted that the novel, as written, would find its place in the world of young adult literature, convinced that the young adult market was entering a period of change, heralded by the earlier appearances of S. E. Hinton&#8217;s <i>The Outsiders</i> and Paul Zindel&#8217;s <i>The Pigman</i>.<br><br>Finally, Fabio Coen, then publisher of Books for Young Readers at Pantheon Books and Knopf, the eighth publisher to whom the book was submitted, accepted it for publication in April of 1973.<br><br>I worried about revisions. Needlessly, as it turned out. At a brief &#8220;editing session&#8221; at Fabio Coen&#8217;s office, his suggestions were few and minor, scrawled on a single sheet of paper. But he was doubtful about a short chapter toward the end of the novel. <br><br>Astonished, I realized it was a chapter I had agonized about earlier, actually removing it at one time, then reinstating it. I had found an editor who shared my instincts and my intentions. The chapter was removed. Otherwise, the novel was published essentially as I wrote it, in April of 1974. Fabio Coen became my mentor and remained so until his retirement several books later. <br><br>The success of <i>The Chocolate War</i> is testimony to all the other heroes involved in its history&#8211;teachers who have taught the book in the face of censorship attempts that sometimes threatened their jobs; librarians who have had to fight to keep the novel available to readers; critics, writers, and educators who supported the novel in countless reviews and essays; all the young people who continue to write me letters, who call me up, who organize protests when the book faces yet another banning threat; Pantheon Books, followed by Knopf and Dell Laurel-Leaf, who have kept the book in continuous print in hardback and softcover.<br><br>Talk about happy endings!<br><i>&#8211;Robert Cormier<br>Leominster, Massachusetts, 1997<br></i>",

      excerpt:
        "THEY MURDERED HIM. <br><br>As he turned to take the ball, a dam burst against the side of his head and a hand grenade shattered his stomach. Engulfed by nausea, he pitched toward the grass. His mouth encountered gravel, and he spat frantically, afraid that some of his teeth had been knocked out. Rising to his feet, he saw the field through drifting gauze but held on until everything settled into place, like a lens focusing, making the world sharp again, with edges.<br> <br>The second play called for a pass. Fading back, he picked up a decent block and cocked his arm, searching for a receiver - maybe the tall kid they called The Goober. Suddenly, he was caught from behind and whirled violently, a toy boat caught in a whirlpool. Landing on his knees, hugging the ball, he urged himself to ignore the pain that gripped his groin, knowing that it was important to betray no sign of distress, remembering The Goober's advice, &quot;Coach is testing you, testing, and he's looking for guts.&quot;<br><br>I've got guts. Jerry murmured, getting up by degrees, careful not to displace any of his bones or sinews. A telephone rang in his ears. Hello, hello, I'm still here. When he moved his lips, he tasted the acid of dirt and grass and gravel. He was aware of the other players around him, helmeted and grotesque, creatures from an unknown world. He had never felt so lonely in his life, abandoned, defenseless.<br><br>On the third play, he was hit simultaneously by three of them: one, his knees; another, his stomach; a third, his head - the helmet no protection at all. His body seemed to telescope into itself but all the parts didn't fit, and he was stunned by the knowledge that pain isn't just one thing - it is cunning and various, sharp here and sickening there, burning here and clawing there. He clutched himself as he hit the ground. The ball squirted away. His breath went away, like the ball - a terrible stillness pervaded him - and then, at the onset of panic, his breath came back again. His lips sprayed wetness and he was grateful for the sweet cool air that filled his lungs. But when he tried to get up, his body mutinied against movement. He decided the hell with it. He'd go to sleep right here, right out on the fifty yard line, the hell with trying out for the team, screw everything, he was going to sleep, he didn't care anymore--<br><br>&quot;Renault!&quot;<br><br>Ridiculous, someone calling his name.<br><br>&quot;Renault!&quot;<br><br>The coach's voice scraped like sandpaper against his ears. He opened his eyes flutteringly. &quot;I'm all right,&quot; he said to nobody in particular, or to his father maybe. Or the coach. He was unwilling to abandon this lovely lassitude but he had to, of course. He was sorry to leave the earth, and he was vaguely curious about how he was going to get up, with both legs smashed and his skull battered in. He was astonished to find himself on his feet, intact, bobbing like one of those toy novelties dangling from car windows, but erect.<br><br>&quot;For Christ's sake,&quot; the coach bellowed, his voice juicy with contempt. A spurt of saliva hit Jerry's cheek.<br><br>Hey, coach, you spit on me, Jerry protested. Stop the spitting, coach. What he said aloud was, &quot;I'm all right, coach,&quot; because he was a coward about stuff like that, thinking one thing and saying another, planning one thing and doing another - he had been Peter a thousand times and a thousand cocks had crowed in his lifetime.<br><br>&quot;How tall are you, Renault?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Five nine,&quot; he gasped, still fighting for breath.<br><br>&quot;Weight?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One forty-five,&quot; he said, looking the coach straight in the eye.<br><br>&quot;Soaking wet, I'll bet,&quot; the coach said sourly. &quot;What the hell you want to play football for? You need more meat on those bones. What the hell you trying to play quarterback for? You'd make a better end. Maybe.&quot;<br><br>The coach looked like an old gangster: broken nose, a scar on his check like a stitched shoestring. He needed a shave, his stubble like slivers of ice. He growled and swore and was merciless. But a helluva coach, they said. The coach stared at him now, the dark eyes probing, pondering. Jerry hung in there, trying not to sway, trying not to faint.<br><br>&quot;All right,&quot; the coach said in disgust. &quot;Show up tomorrow. Three o'clock sharp or you're through before you start.&quot;<br><br>Inhaling the sweet sharp apple air through his nostrils - he was afraid to open his mouth wide, wary of any movement that was not absolutely essential - he walked tentatively toward the sidelines, listening to the coach barking at the other guys. Suddenly, he loved that voice, &quot;Show up tomorrow.&quot;<br><br>He trudged away from the field, blinking against the afternoon sun, toward the locker room at the gym. His knees were liquid and his body light as air, suddenly.<br><br>Know what? He asked himself, a game he played sometimes. <br><br><i>What?</i><br><br>I'm going to make the team.<br><br><i>Dreamer, dreamer.</i><br><br>Not a dream: it's the truth.<br><br>As Jerry took another deep breath, a pain appeared, distant, small - a radar signal of distress. Bleep, I'm here. Pain. His feet scuffled through crazy cornflake leaves. A strange happiness invaded him. He knew he'd been massacred by the oncoming players, capsized and dumped humiliatingly on the ground. But he'd survived - he'd gotten to his feet. &quot;You'd make a better end.&quot; Was the coach thinking he might try him at end? Any position, as long as he made the team. The bleep grew larger, localized now, between his ribs on the right side. He thought of his mother and how drugged she was at the end, not recognizing anyone, neither Jerry nor his father. The exhilaration of the moment vanished and he sought it in vain, like seeking ecstasy's memory an instant after jacking off and encountering only shame and guilt. <br><br>Nausea began to spread through his stomach, warm and oozy and evil.<br><br>&quot;Hey,&quot; he called weakly. To nobody. Nobody there to listen.<br><br>He managed to make it back to the school. By the time he had sprawled himself on the floor of the lavatory, his head hanging over the lip of the toilet bowl and the smell of disinfectant stinging his eyeballs, the nausea had passed and the bleep of pain had faded. Sweat moved like small moist bugs on his forehead.<br><br>And then, without warning, he vomited.",

        "As a child,<b> Diane Goode</b> loved books and art. She has been drawing&#160;for as long as&#160;she can remember. Of Italian and French descent, she enjoyed the richness of both cultures and traveled to Europe every summer visiting family, as well as cathedrals and museums. She feels that these early impressions helped shape her appreciation of art and life. She studied art history at Queens College, but switched to fine arts, in which she earned her degree.Her love for Europe shows in the setting of many of her books, Paris in particular, where two of her picture books, <i>Where's Our Mama? </i>and <i>Mama's Perfect Present,</i>&#160;take place. She drew on her experience of living for a short time in Pennsylvania for the artwork&#160;in Cynthia Rylant's story of Appalachia, <i>When I Was Young in the Mountains</i>, for which she was awarded a Caldecott Honor Medal. <p>Goode has illustrated 59 books for children, including anthologies and stories she has written herself. She's&#160;always been drawn to the classics and has illustrated many traditional fairy tales. Of her process she says: \"I always begin with a rough dummy and then work on the individual pages, sketching very loosely and quickly to establish movement and composition. I do these dozens of times for each repositioning, enlarging, reducing, adding, and omitting. There are always hundreds of sketches&#160;for each&#160;book. It sounds tedious, but it is the most exciting part of creating a book. When I'm satisfied with these, I do the final art. All of my work is done on opaline parchment, a thin but strong paper. I sketch lightly in pencil and use water colors applied with very fine sable brushes. Sometimes I use colored pencils with the paint to soften the atmosphere.\"Goode lives in Watchung, New Jersey.</p>",

        "<b>Patsy Scarry</b> (1924&ndash;1995) wrote many stories for children, some of which were were illustrated by her husband, Richard Scarry, including <i>Good Night, Little Bear</i> and <i>The Bunny Book</i>. Her classic holiday book, <i>The Sweet Smell of Christmas</i>, remains a yearly yuletide favorite. &#160;<br><br><b>Richard Scarry</b> is one of the world's best-loved children's authors EVER! Generations of children all over the world have grown up spending hours poring over his books filled with all the colorful details of their daily lives. No other illustrator has shown such a lively interest in the words and concepts of early childhood. For himself, whenever he was asked how old he was, Scarry would always put up one hand and laugh, saying, \"five!\" &#160; Born in 1919, Richard Scarry was raised and educated in Boston, Massachusetts. After five years of drawing maps and designing graphics for the US Army, he moved to New York to pursue a career in commercial art. But after showing his portfolio to one of the original editors at Golden Books, he found the perfect home for his children's books. &#160; The assignments first given to Scarry tended to be Little Golden Books that featured popular characters of the day, such as Winky Dink, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Smokey the Bear. Eventually Scarry created many original characters, such as Lowly Worm and Huckle Cat. But first came Nicholas, a young rabbit clad in red overalls, for the now-iconic board book&#160;<i>I Am a Bunny</i>. After Scarry married children's textbook writer Patricia Murphy, she wrote many stories for him as Patsy Scarry, including the bestselling Little Golden Books&#160;<i>Good Night, Little Bear</i>&#160;and&#160;<i>The Bunny Book</i>.  In his extraordinary career, Richard Scarry illustrated more than 150 books, many of which have never been out of print. His books have sold over 100 million copies around the world and are currently published in more than 20 languages. Richard Scarry Jr., also an illustrator, carries on his father's work today under the name of Huck Scarry. Richard Scarry passed away at his home in Gstaad, Switzerland, in 1994. He was posthumously awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of Illustrators in 2012.",

      excerpt:
        "<b>Chapter 2<br><br>The Return of the Iron Giant</b><br><br>One evening a farmer's son, a boy called Hogarth, was fishing in a stream that ran down to the sea. It was growing too dark to fish, his hook kept getting caught in weeds and bushes. So he stopped fishing and came up from the stream and stood listening to the owls in the wood further up the valley, and to the sea behind him. Hush, said the sea. And again, Hush. Hush. Hush.<br><br>Suddenly he felt a strange feeling. He felt he was being watched. He felt afraid. He turned and looked up the steep field to the top of the high cliff. Behind that skyline was the sheer rocky cliff and the sea. And on that skyline, just above the edge of it, in the dusk, were two green lights. What were two green lights doing at the top of the cliff?<br><br>Then, as Hogarth watched, a huge dark figure climbed up over the cliff top. The two lights rose into the sky. They were the giant figure's eyes. A giant black figure, taller than a house, black and towering in the twilight, with green headlight eyes. The Iron Giant! There he stood on the cliff top, looking inland. Hogarth began to run. He ran and ran. Home. Home. The Iron Giant had come back.<br><br>So he got home at last and, gasping for breath, he told his dad. An Iron Giant! An Iron Man! A giant!<br><br>His father frowned. His mother grew pale. His little sister began to cry.<br><br>His father took down his double-barreled gun. He believed his son. He went out. He locked the door. He got in his car. He drove to the next farm.<br><br>But that farmer laughed. He was a fat, red man, with a fat, red-mouthed laugh. When he stopped laughing, his eyes were red too. An Iron Giant? Nonsense, he said.<br><br>So Hogarth's father got back in his car. Now it was dark and it had begun to rain. He drove to the next farm.<br><br>That farmer frowned. He believed. Tomorrow, he said, we must see what he is, this iron giant. His feet will have left tracks in the earth.<br><br>So Hogarth's father again got back into his car. But as he turned the car in the yard, he saw a strange thing in the headlights. Half a tractor lay there, just half, chopped clean off, the other half missing. He got out of his car and the other farmer came to look too. The tractor had been bitten off -- there were big teeth marks in the steel.<br><br>No explanation! The two men looked at each other. They were puzzled and afraid. What could have bitten the tractor in two? There, in the yard, in the rain, in the night, while they had been talking inside the house.<br><br>The farmer ran in and bolted his door.<br><br>Hogarth's father jumped into his car and drove off into the night and the rain as fast as he could, homeward.<br><br>The rain poured down. Hogarth's father drove hard. The headlights lit up the road and bushes.<br><br>Suddenly -- two headlights in a tall treetop at the roadside ahead. Headlights in a treetop? How?<br><br>Hogarth's father slowed, peering up to see what the lights might be, up there in the treetop.<br><br>As he slowed, a giant iron foot came down in the middle of the road, a foot as big as a single bed. And the headlights came down closer. And a giant hand reached down toward the windshield.<br><br>The Iron Giant!<br><br>Hogarth's father put on speed, he aimed his car at the foot.<br><br>Crash! He knocked the foot out of the way.<br><br>He drove on, faster and faster. And behind him, on the road, a clanging clattering boom went up, as if an iron skyscraper had collapsed. The iron giant, with his foot knocked from under him, had toppled over.<br><br>And so Hogarth's father got home safely.<br><br>BUT<br><br>Next morning all the farmers were shouting with anger. Where were their tractors? Their earth-diggers? Their plows? Their harrows? From every farm in the region, all the steel and iron farm machinery had gone. Where to? Who had stolen it all?<br><br>There was a clue. Here and there lay half a wheel, or half an axle, or half a mudguard, carved with giant toothmarks where it had been bitten off. How had it been bitten off? <i>Steel</i> bitten off?<br><br>What had happened?<br><br>There was another clue.<br><br>From farm to farm, over the soft soil of the fields, went giant footprints, each one the size of a single bed.<br><br>The farmers, in a frightened, silent, amazed crowd, followed the footprints. And at every farm the footprints visited, all the metal machinery had disappeared.<br><br>Finally, the footprints led back up to the top of the cliff, where the little boy had seen the Iron Giant appear the night before, when he was fishing. The footprints led right to the cliff top.<br><br>And all the way down the cliff were torn marks on the rocks, where a huge iron body had slid down. Below, the tide was in. The gray, empty, moving tide. The Iron Giant had gone back into the sea.<br><br>SO<br><br>The furious farmers began to shout. The Iron Giant had stolen all their machinery. Had he eaten it? Anyway, he had taken it. It had gone. So what if he came again? What would he take next time? Cows? Houses? People?<br><br>They would have to do something.<br><br>They couldn't call in the police or the army, because nobody would believe them about this Iron Monster. They would have to do something for themselves.<br><br>So, what did they do?<br><br>At the bottom of the hill, below where the Iron Giant had come over the high cliff, they dug a deep, enormous hole. A hole wider than a house, and as deep as three trees one on top of the other. It was a colossal hole. A stupendous hole! And the sides of it were sheer as walls.<br><br>They pushed all the earth off to one side. They covered the hole with branches and the branches were covered with straw and the straw with soil, so when they finished the hole looked like a freshly plowed field.<br><br>Now, on the side of the hole opposite the slope up to the top of the cliff, they put an old rusty truck. That was the bait. Now they reckoned the Iron Giant would come over the top of the cliff out of the sea, and he'd see the old truck which was painted red, and he'd come down to get it to chew it up and eat it. But on his way to the truck he'd be crossing the hole, and the moment he stepped with his great weight onto that soil held up only with straw and branches, he would crash through into the hole and would never get out. They'd find him there in the hole. Then they'd bring the few bulldozers and earth-movers that he hadn't already eaten, and they'd push the pile of earth in on top of him, and bury him forever in the hole. They were certain now that they'd get him.<br><br>Next morning, in great excitement, all the farmers gathered together to go along to examine their trap. They came carefully closer, expecting to see hands tearing at the edge of the pit. They came carefully closer.<br><br>The red truck stood just as they had left it. The soil lay just as they had left it, undisturbed. Everything was just as they had left it. The Iron Giant had not come.<br><br>Nor did he come that day.<br><br>Next morning, all the farmers came again. Still, everything lay just as they had left it.<br>And so it went on, day after day. Still the Iron Giant never came.<br><br>Now the farmers began to wonder if he would ever come again. They began to wonder if he had ever come at all. They began to make up explanations of what had happened to their machinery. Nobody likes to believe in an Iron Monster that eats tractors and cars.<br><br>Soon, the farmer who owned the red truck they were using as bait decided that he needed it, and he took it away. So there lay the beautiful deep trap, without any bait. Grass began to grow on the loose soil.<br><br>The farmers talked of filling the hole in. After all, you can't leave a giant pit like that, somebody might fall in. Some stranger coming along might just walk over it and fall in.<br>But they didn't want to fill it in. It had been such hard work digging it. Besides they all had a sneaking fear that the Iron Giant might come again, and the hole was their only weapon against him.<br><br>At last they put up a little notice: DANGER: KEEP OFF, to warn people away, and they left it at that.<br><br>Now the little boy Hogarth had an idea. He thought he could use that hole to trap a fox. He found a dead hen one day, and threw it out on the loose soil over the trap. Then toward evening, he climbed a tree nearby and waited. A long time he waited. A star came out. He could hear the sea.<br><br>Then -- there, standing at the edge of the hole, was a fox. A big, red fox, looking toward the dead hen. Hogarth stopped breathing. And the fox stood without moving -- sniff, sniff, sniff, out toward the hen. But he did not step out onto the trap. Slowly, he walked around the wide patch of raw soil till he got back to where he'd started, sniffing all the time out toward the bird. But he did not step out onto the trap. Was he too smart to walk out there where it was not safe?<br><br>But at that moment he stopped sniffing. He turned his head and looked toward the top of the cliff. Hogarth, wondering what the fox had seen, looked toward the top of the cliff.<br><br>There, enormous in the blue evening sky, stood the Iron Giant, on the brink of the cliff, gazing inland.<br><br>In a moment, the fox had vanished.<br><br>Now what?<br><br>Hogarth carefully, quietly, hardly breathing, climbed slowly down the tree. He must get home and tell his father. But at the bottom of the tree he stopped. He could no longer see the Iron Giant against the twilight sky. Had he gone back over the cliff into the sea? Or was he coming down the hill, in the darkness under that high skyline, toward Hogarth and the farms?<br><br>Then Hogarth understood what was happening. He could hear a strange tearing and creaking sound. The Iron Giant was pulling up the barbed wire fence that led down the hill. And soon Hogarth could see him, as he came nearer, tearing the wire from the fence posts, rolling it up like spaghetti and eating it. The Iron Giant was eating the barbed fencing wire.<br><br>But if he went along the fence, eating as he moved, he wouldn't come anywhere near the trap, which was out in the middle of the field. He could spend the whole night wandering about the countryside along the fences, rolling up the wire and eating it, and never would any fence bring him near the trap.<br><br>But Hogarth had an idea. In his pocket, among other things, he had a long nail and a knife. He took these out. Did he dare? His idea frightened him. In the silent dusk, he tapped the nail and the knife blade together.<br><br>Clink, Clink, Clink!<br><br>At the sound of the metal, the Iron Giant's hands became still. After a few seconds, he slowly turned his head and the headlight eyes shone toward Hogarth.<br><br>Again, Clink, Clink, Clink! went the nail on the knife.<br><br>Slowly, the Iron Giant took three strides toward Hogarth, and again stopped. It was now quite dark. The headlights shone red. Hogarth pressed close to the tree trunk. Between him and the Iron Giant lay the wide lid of the trap.<br><br>Clink, Clink, Clink! again he tapped the nail on the knife.<br><br>And now the Iron Giant was coming. Hogarth could feel the earth shaking under the weight of his footsteps. Was it too late to run? Hogarth stared at the Iron Giant, looming, searching toward him for the taste of the metal that had made that inviting sound.<br><br>Clink, Clink, Clink! went the nail on the knife. And<br><br>CRASSSHHH!<br><br>The Iron Giant vanished.<br><br>He was in the pit. The Iron Giant had fallen into the pit. Hogarth went close. The earth was shaking as the Iron Giant struggled underground. Hogarth peered over the torn edge of the great pit. Far below, two deep red headlights glared up at him from the pitch blackness. He could hear the Iron Giant's insides grinding down there and it sounded like a big truck grinding its gears on a steep hill. Hogarth set off. He ran, he ran, home -- home with the great news. And as he passed the cottages on the way, and as he turned down the lane toward his father's farm, he was shouting, &quot;The Iron Giant's in the trap!&quot; and &quot;We've caught the Iron Giant.&quot;<br><br>When the farmers saw the Iron Giant wallowing in their deep pit, they sent up a great cheer. He glared up toward them, his eyes burned from red to purple, from purple to white, from white to fiery whirling black and red, and the cogs inside him ground and screeched, but he could not climb out of the steep-sided pit.<br><br>Then under the beams of car headlights, the farmers brought bulldozers and earth-pushers, and they began to push in on top of the struggling Iron Giant all the earth they had dug when they first made the pit and that had been piled off to one side.<br><br>The Iron Giant roared again as the earth began to fall on him. But soon he roared no more. Soon the pit was full of earth. Soon the Iron Giant was buried silent, packed down under all the soil, while the farmers piled the earth over him in a mound and in a hill. They went to and fro over the mound on their new tractors, which they'd bought since the Iron Giant ate their old ones, and they packed the earth down hard. Then they all went home talking cheerfully. They were sure they had seen the last of the Iron Giant.<br><br>Only Hogarth felt suddenly sorry. He felt guilty. It was he, after all, who had lured the Iron Giant into the pit.",

        "Leo Lionni, an internationally known designer, illustrator, and graphic artist, was born in Holland and lived in Italy until he came to the United States in 1939. He was the recipient of the 1984 American Institute of Graphic Arts Gold Medal and was honored posthumously in 2007 with the Society of Illustrators&rsquo; Lifetime Achievement Award. His picture books are distinguished by their enduring moral themes, graphic simplicity and brilliant use of collage, and include four Caldecott Honor Books: <i>Inch by Inch, Frederick, Swimmy,</i> and <i>Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse.</i> Hailed as &ldquo;a master of the simple fable&rdquo; by the <i>Chicago Tribune,</i> he died in 1999 at the age of 89.",

        "Dr. Seuss was born Theodor Geisel in Springfield, Massachusetts on March 2, 1904.  After attending Dartmouth College and Oxford University, he began a career in advertising.  His advertising cartoons, featuring Quick, Henry, the Flit!,  appeared in several leading American magazines.<br> Dr. Seuss's first children's book, And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street, hit the market in 1937, and the world of children's literature was changed forever!<br> In 1957, Seuss's The Cat in the Hat became the prototype for one of Random House's best- selling series, Beginner Books.  This popular series combined engaging stories with outrageous illustrations and playful sounds to teach basic reading skills.<br> Brilliant, playful, and always respectful of children, Dr. Seuss charmed his way into the consciousness of four generations of youngsters and parents.  In the process, he helped kids learn to read.<br> Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1984 and three Academy Awards, Seuss was the author and illustrator of 44 children's books, some of which have been made into audiocassettes, animated television specials, and videos for children of all ages.  Even after his death in 1991, Dr. Seuss continues to be the best-selling author of children's books in the world.",

        "<i>The following introduction to </i>The Chocolate War <i>was written by Robert Cormier in 1997.<br><br>The Chocolate War</i> was written during weekday evening hours and Saturday mornings in parts of 1969, 1970, and 1971 while I was working full-time as a newspaper editor and columnist.<br><br>Writing the novel was a labor of love. Although the setting was a Catholic boys&#8217; high school, I regarded the school as a metaphor for the world. On the other hand, I knew that, on its primary level, this was a story about a school chocolate sale. Who would be interested in reading such a story? I sometimes wondered. Yet I was having such a good time as the words leaped and danced on the page and the characters of Jerry Renault, Archie Costello, and Brother Leon came alive that I didn&#8217;t worry about it. <br><br>It seems incredible to me that more than two decades later, <i>The Chocolate War</i> continues to be read and taught (and to cause problems) in classrooms here in the United States and in such places as England, Australia, Sweden, France, and Japan, among others.<br><br>Yet the novel was almost stillborn and existed for more than a year in a kind of literary no-man&#8217;s-land. Seven major publishers rejected it over the course of thirteen months in 1972 and 1973. The reasons? Too complicated. Too many characters. A downbeat ending, which teenagers of the 1970s would find difficult to accept. Too violent. Not quite an adult novel, too sophisticated to be a juvenile novel. Too unbelievable. That frustrating &#8220;Not for us,&#8221; without further comment. One publisher, however, seriously considered accepting it if some changes were made, particularly to the ending.<br><br>I decided not to change or revise the novel. This was not a heroic gesture but an act of innocence. I knew nothing of the young adult market, was unaware of its then traditions and taboos, the domination of &#8220;safe&#8221; stories with role-model heroes walking off into the sunset of happy endings.<br><br>Although <i>The Chocolate War</i> does not have that hoped-for happy ending, its history has had happy moments and its share of heroes.<br><br>My son, Peter, inspired the novel when he refused, as a matter of principle, to sell the chocolates at his school&#8217;s annual sale.<br><br>Marilyn E. Marlow, my literary agent at Curtis Brown Ltd., supported my decision against revisions and insisted that the novel, as written, would find its place in the world of young adult literature, convinced that the young adult market was entering a period of change, heralded by the earlier appearances of S. E. Hinton&#8217;s <i>The Outsiders</i> and Paul Zindel&#8217;s <i>The Pigman</i>.<br><br>Finally, Fabio Coen, then publisher of Books for Young Readers at Pantheon Books and Knopf, the eighth publisher to whom the book was submitted, accepted it for publication in April of 1973.<br><br>I worried about revisions. Needlessly, as it turned out. At a brief &#8220;editing session&#8221; at Fabio Coen&#8217;s office, his suggestions were few and minor, scrawled on a single sheet of paper. But he was doubtful about a short chapter toward the end of the novel. <br><br>Astonished, I realized it was a chapter I had agonized about earlier, actually removing it at one time, then reinstating it. I had found an editor who shared my instincts and my intentions. The chapter was removed. Otherwise, the novel was published essentially as I wrote it, in April of 1974. Fabio Coen became my mentor and remained so until his retirement several books later. <br><br>The success of <i>The Chocolate War</i> is testimony to all the other heroes involved in its history&#8211;teachers who have taught the book in the face of censorship attempts that sometimes threatened their jobs; librarians who have had to fight to keep the novel available to readers; critics, writers, and educators who supported the novel in countless reviews and essays; all the young people who continue to write me letters, who call me up, who organize protests when the book faces yet another banning threat; Pantheon Books, followed by Knopf and Dell Laurel-Leaf, who have kept the book in continuous print in hardback and softcover.<br><br>Talk about happy endings!<br><i>&#8211;Robert Cormier<br>Leominster, Massachusetts, 1997<br></i>",

      excerpt:
        "THEY MURDERED HIM. <br><br>As he turned to take the ball, a dam burst against the side of his head and a hand grenade shattered his stomach. Engulfed by nausea, he pitched toward the grass. His mouth encountered gravel, and he spat frantically, afraid that some of his teeth had been knocked out. Rising to his feet, he saw the field through drifting gauze but held on until everything settled into place, like a lens focusing, making the world sharp again, with edges.<br> <br>The second play called for a pass. Fading back, he picked up a decent block and cocked his arm, searching for a receiver - maybe the tall kid they called The Goober. Suddenly, he was caught from behind and whirled violently, a toy boat caught in a whirlpool. Landing on his knees, hugging the ball, he urged himself to ignore the pain that gripped his groin, knowing that it was important to betray no sign of distress, remembering The Goober's advice, &quot;Coach is testing you, testing, and he's looking for guts.&quot;<br><br>I've got guts. Jerry murmured, getting up by degrees, careful not to displace any of his bones or sinews. A telephone rang in his ears. Hello, hello, I'm still here. When he moved his lips, he tasted the acid of dirt and grass and gravel. He was aware of the other players around him, helmeted and grotesque, creatures from an unknown world. He had never felt so lonely in his life, abandoned, defenseless.<br><br>On the third play, he was hit simultaneously by three of them: one, his knees; another, his stomach; a third, his head - the helmet no protection at all. His body seemed to telescope into itself but all the parts didn't fit, and he was stunned by the knowledge that pain isn't just one thing - it is cunning and various, sharp here and sickening there, burning here and clawing there. He clutched himself as he hit the ground. The ball squirted away. His breath went away, like the ball - a terrible stillness pervaded him - and then, at the onset of panic, his breath came back again. His lips sprayed wetness and he was grateful for the sweet cool air that filled his lungs. But when he tried to get up, his body mutinied against movement. He decided the hell with it. He'd go to sleep right here, right out on the fifty yard line, the hell with trying out for the team, screw everything, he was going to sleep, he didn't care anymore--<br><br>&quot;Renault!&quot;<br><br>Ridiculous, someone calling his name.<br><br>&quot;Renault!&quot;<br><br>The coach's voice scraped like sandpaper against his ears. He opened his eyes flutteringly. &quot;I'm all right,&quot; he said to nobody in particular, or to his father maybe. Or the coach. He was unwilling to abandon this lovely lassitude but he had to, of course. He was sorry to leave the earth, and he was vaguely curious about how he was going to get up, with both legs smashed and his skull battered in. He was astonished to find himself on his feet, intact, bobbing like one of those toy novelties dangling from car windows, but erect.<br><br>&quot;For Christ's sake,&quot; the coach bellowed, his voice juicy with contempt. A spurt of saliva hit Jerry's cheek.<br><br>Hey, coach, you spit on me, Jerry protested. Stop the spitting, coach. What he said aloud was, &quot;I'm all right, coach,&quot; because he was a coward about stuff like that, thinking one thing and saying another, planning one thing and doing another - he had been Peter a thousand times and a thousand cocks had crowed in his lifetime.<br><br>&quot;How tall are you, Renault?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Five nine,&quot; he gasped, still fighting for breath.<br><br>&quot;Weight?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One forty-five,&quot; he said, looking the coach straight in the eye.<br><br>&quot;Soaking wet, I'll bet,&quot; the coach said sourly. &quot;What the hell you want to play football for? You need more meat on those bones. What the hell you trying to play quarterback for? You'd make a better end. Maybe.&quot;<br><br>The coach looked like an old gangster: broken nose, a scar on his check like a stitched shoestring. He needed a shave, his stubble like slivers of ice. He growled and swore and was merciless. But a helluva coach, they said. The coach stared at him now, the dark eyes probing, pondering. Jerry hung in there, trying not to sway, trying not to faint.<br><br>&quot;All right,&quot; the coach said in disgust. &quot;Show up tomorrow. Three o'clock sharp or you're through before you start.&quot;<br><br>Inhaling the sweet sharp apple air through his nostrils - he was afraid to open his mouth wide, wary of any movement that was not absolutely essential - he walked tentatively toward the sidelines, listening to the coach barking at the other guys. Suddenly, he loved that voice, &quot;Show up tomorrow.&quot;<br><br>He trudged away from the field, blinking against the afternoon sun, toward the locker room at the gym. His knees were liquid and his body light as air, suddenly.<br><br>Know what? He asked himself, a game he played sometimes. <br><br><i>What?</i><br><br>I'm going to make the team.<br><br><i>Dreamer, dreamer.</i><br><br>Not a dream: it's the truth.<br><br>As Jerry took another deep breath, a pain appeared, distant, small - a radar signal of distress. Bleep, I'm here. Pain. His feet scuffled through crazy cornflake leaves. A strange happiness invaded him. He knew he'd been massacred by the oncoming players, capsized and dumped humiliatingly on the ground. But he'd survived - he'd gotten to his feet. &quot;You'd make a better end.&quot; Was the coach thinking he might try him at end? Any position, as long as he made the team. The bleep grew larger, localized now, between his ribs on the right side. He thought of his mother and how drugged she was at the end, not recognizing anyone, neither Jerry nor his father. The exhilaration of the moment vanished and he sought it in vain, like seeking ecstasy's memory an instant after jacking off and encountering only shame and guilt. <br><br>Nausea began to spread through his stomach, warm and oozy and evil.<br><br>&quot;Hey,&quot; he called weakly. To nobody. Nobody there to listen.<br><br>He managed to make it back to the school. By the time he had sprawled himself on the floor of the lavatory, his head hanging over the lip of the toilet bowl and the smell of disinfectant stinging his eyeballs, the nausea had passed and the bleep of pain had faded. Sweat moved like small moist bugs on his forehead.<br><br>And then, without warning, he vomited.",

        "In Robert Cormier's unforgettable novels, an individual often stands alone, fighting for what is right--or just to survive--against powerful, sinister, and sometimes evil people. His twisty, gripping stories explore some of the darker corners of the human psyche but always with a moral focus and a probing intelligence that compels readers to examine their own feelings and ethical beliefs. The questions that follow are intended to spur discussion and to provoke thoughtful readers to contemplate some of the issues of identity, character, emotion, and morality that make Cormier's books so compelling.<br><br>Pre-Reading Activity<br><br>Tell students that Jerry Renault has a poster in his locker with the following quote from T. S. Eliot&#8217;s <i>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock: </i> &#8220;Do I Dare Disturb the Universe?&#8221; Divide students into small groups and ask them to interpret the quote. What is their universe? Who controls their universe? What price does one pay when they elect to disturb the universe?",

        "<p>1. Jerry places a poster in his locker that says, &#8220;Do I Dare Disturb the Universe?&#8221; At first, he doesn&#8217;t understand the meaning of the poster; he just likes it. At what point in the novel does it appear that Jerry is beginning to get the meaning of the poster?</p><p>2. Contrast Jerry&#8217;s definition of &#8220;his universe&#8221; at the beginning and the end of the novel.</p><p>3. How does Jerry become a martyr by disturbing his universe?</p><p>4. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, &#8220;Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.&#8221; Discuss how Jerry might interpret this quote. How does Emerson promote nonconformity and disturbing the universe? Debate whether Jerry leaves a trail at Trinity.</p><p>5. <i>The Chocolate War</i> is one of the most censored books in America. It is under perpetual attack because of Cormier&#8217;s &#8220;negative portrayal of human nature,&#8221; and because the ending appears hopeless. Discuss the objections to the book, and think about how Cormier &#8220;disturbed the universe&#8221; by writing the novel. Why do people fear a realistic portrayal of life? What is the relationship between looking at the &#8220;good and evils&#8221; of life to &#8220;disturbing the universe&#8221;?</p><p>6. How do gangs and secret societies like the Vigils use peer pressure to gain power and control?</p><p>7. What is the significance of the scene where Jerry encounters the hippies? Discuss how they make him question his place among his peers.</p><p>8. How is misinformation about the chocolate sale used to maintain peer pressure? Discuss how this tactic affects Goober, who quit selling the chocolates after 27 boxes.</p><p>9. Discuss the relationship between peer pressure and conformity.</p><p>10. Compare and contrast the peer pressure at Trinity with peer pressure in your own school. Brother Leon actually promotes peer pressure at Trinity. Discuss ways a school administrator should deal with peer pressure. What should students do if they feel they are the victims of extreme peer pressure?</p><p>11. Archie Costello, one of the leaders of the Vigils, doesn&#8217;t believe in violence. How does this make him different from the typical school bully?

How do they control the social order of the school? <b><br></b></p><p>17. Archie Costello is a legend at Trinity High School because he is the &#8220;Assigner&#8221; for the Vigils. How does this position give him power over the entire student body? How does Archie use manipulation to gain power? How is his power recognized and used by Brother Leon?</p><p>18. Brother Leon becomes drunk with power when he is named acting headmaster of Trinity. How is his desire for power in conflict with his training as a priest?</p><p>19. Discuss the relationship between power and corruption. How might Goober describe the corruption, or the evil, at Trinity High School?</p><p>20. How is Brother Leon&#8217;s corruption revealed?</p><p>21. How does the opening scene on the football field foreshadow Jerry&#8217;s courage?</p><p>22. Archie Costello is considered courageous and gutsy. Debate whether he is as courageous as he appears. Why does Archie fear that he may pick a black marble from the box? How might a black marble change his image and position among the Vigils?</p><p>23. Discuss how Goober deals with his fear. How might Goober describe Jerry&#8217;s courage?</p><p>24. How are the Vigils affected when Jerry doesn&#8217;t succumb to their fear tactics? Discuss how this leads to his ultimate downfall.</p><p>25. Discuss how Jerry might reflect upon his own courage at the end of the novel.</p><p>26. The first sentence of this book is &quot;They murdered him.&quot; In what ways does this small sentence apply to the book as a whole? Who is murdered, metaphorically, in the book? By whom?</p><p>27. There are no main female characters in this book, partly because Trinity is a boys' school. Yet the Trinity boys often discuss girls. Jerry wishes he could talk to the girl near the bus stop. Janza watches girls as they walk by, and Archie won't let anyone touch him except certain girls. What function(s) do you think girls play in the novel?</p><p>28. Why do you think Archie is repulsed by human sweat? What do you think this says about Archie as a person?</p><p>29. Archie's greatest strength is in exploiting other people's weaknesses. Why do you think Archie does this? Why do you think he needs to manipulate every situation?</p><p>30. Discuss the significance of the title. Why is it a chocolate &quot;war&quot;?</p><p>31. Why do you think Jerry decides not to sell the chocolates even after his assignment is over? Have you ever dared to &quot;disturb the universe&quot;? What happened?</p><p>32. How do you feel about how Brother Leon treated Bailey? At the end of the class Brother Leon says that the students had allowed him to turn the class into Nazi Germany. Do you think this is a true statement?</p>",

        "<p><b>JANETTE SEBRING LOWREY </b>(1892-1986), a Texan, wrote mostly teen fiction during the 1940s and 1950s. Her young adult novel&#160;<i>Margaret&#160;</i>was adapted into a TV serial,&#160;<i>Walt Disney Presents: Annette,&#160;</i>which aired on&#160;<i>The Mickey Mouse Club</i>&#160;in 1958, starring Annette Funicello. But Lowrey is best known as the author of&#160;<i>The Poky Little Puppy,</i>&#160;which was one of the original twelve Little Golden Books that launched in 1942. It went on to become an icon, and the bestselling picture book of all time.</p><p><b>GUSTAF TENGGREN&#160;</b>(1896&ndash;1970) was a well-known illustrator in his native Sweden before immigrating to the United States in 1920. He illustrated many Golden Books, beginning with&#160;<i>The Poky Little Puppy.&#160;</i>One of the original twelve Little Golden Books&#160;published in 1942,&#160;<i>The Poky Little Puppy&#160;</i>went on to become the bestselling picture book of all time. Other iconic Little Golden Books illustrated by Tenggren include&#160;<i>The Saggy Baggy Elephant&#160;</i>and&#160;<i>Tawny Scrawny Lion.&#160;</i>In the late 1930s, Tenggren worked for the Disney Studio, providing concept artwork (created to inspire and guide animators) for various characters and scenes in&#160;<i>Bambi, The Old Mill, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio,&#160;</i>and&#160;<i>Fantasia.</i></p>",

      excerpt:
        '1&#160;&#160; <br><br>Birthday Presents&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br><br>It was not that Omri didn\'t appreciate Patrick\'s birthday present to him. Far from it. He was really very grateful--sort of. It was, without a doubt, very kind of Patrick to give Omri anything at all, let alone a secondhand plastic Indian that he himself had finished with.&#160;&#160; <br><br>The trouble was, though, that Omri was getting a little fed up with small plastic figures, of which he had loads. Biscuit tinsful, probably three or four if they were all put away at the same time, which they never were because most of the time they were scattered about in the bathroom, the loft, the kitchen, the breakfast room, not to mention Omri\'s bedroom and the garden. The compost heap was full of soldiers which, over several autumns, had been raked up with the leaves by Omri\'s mother, who was rather careless about such things.&#160;&#160; <br><br>Omri and Patrick had spent many hours together playing with their joint collections of plastic toys. But now they\'d had about enough of them, at least for the moment, and that was why, when Patrick brought his present to school on Omri\'s birthday, Omri was disappointed. He tried not to show it, but he was.&#160;&#160; <br><br>"Do you really like him?" asked Patrick as Omri stood silently with the Indian in his hand.&#160;&#160; <br><br>"Yes, he\'s fantastic," said Omri in only a slightly flattish voice. "I haven\'t got an Indian."&#160;&#160; <br><br>"I know."&#160;&#160; <br><br>"I haven\'t got any cowboys either."&#160;&#160; <br><br>"Nor have I. That\'s why I couldn\'t play anything with him."&#160;&#160; <br><br>Omri opened his mouth to say, "I won\'t be able to either," but, thinking that might hurt Patrick\'s feelings, he said nothing, put the Indian in his pocket, and forgot about it.&#160;&#160; <br><br>After school there was a family tea, and all the excitement of his presents from his parents and his two older brothers. He got his dearest wish--a skateboard complete with kickboard and kryptonic wheels from his mum and dad, and from his eldest brother, Adiel, a helmet. Gillon, his other brother, hadn\'t bought him anything because he had no money (his pocket money had been stopped some time ago in connection with a very unfortunate accident involving their father\'s bicycle). So when Gillon\'s turn came to give Omri a present, Omri was very surprised when a large parcel was put before him, untidily wrapped in brown paper and string.&#160;&#160; <br><br>"What is it?"&#160;&#160; <br><br>"Have a look. I found it in the alley."&#160;&#160; <br><br>The alley was a narrow passage that ran along the bottom of the garden where the dustbins stood. The three boys used to play there sometimes, and occasionally found treasures that other--perhaps richer--neighbors had thrown away. So Omri was quite excitedas he tore off the paper.&#160;&#160; <br><br>Inside was a small white metal cupboard with a mirror in the door, the kind you see over the basin in old-fashioned bathrooms.&#160;&#160; <br><br>You might suppose Omri would get another disappointment about this because the cupboard was fairly plain and, except for a shelf, completely empty, but oddly enough he was very pleased with it. He loved cupboards of any sort because of the fun of keeping things in them. He was not a very tidy boy in general, but he did like arranging things in cupboards and drawers and then opening them later and finding them just as he\'d left them.&#160;&#160; <br><br>"I do wish it locked," he said.&#160;&#160; <br><br>"You might say thank you before you start complaining," said Gillon.&#160;&#160; <br><br>"It\'s got a keyhole," said their mother. "And I\'ve got a whole boxful of keys. Why don\'t you try all the smaller ones and see if any of them fit?"&#160;&#160; <br><br>Most of the keys were much too big, but there were half a dozen that were about the right size. All but one of these were very ordinary. The unordinary one was the most interesting key in the whole collection, small with a complicated lock part and a fancytop. A narrow strip of red satin ribbon was looped through one of its curly openings. Omri saved that key to the last.&#160;&#160; <br><br>None of the others fitted, and at last he picked up the curly-topped key and carefully put it in the keyhole on the cupboard door, just below the knob. He did hope very much that it would turn, and regretted wasting his birthday-cake-cutting wish on something so silly (or rather, unlikely) as that he might pass his spelling test next day, which it would take real magic to bring about as he hadn\'t even looked at the words since they\'d been given out four days ago. Now he closed his eyes and unwished the test pass and wished instead that this little twisty key would turn Gillon\'s present into a secret cupboard.&#160;&#160; <br><br>The key turned smoothly in the lock. The door wouldn\'t open.&#160;&#160; <br><br>"Hey! Mum! I\'ve found one!"&#160;&#160; <br><br>"Have you, darling? Which one?" His mother came to look. "Oh that one! How very odd. That was the key to my grandmother\'s jewel box, that she got from Florence. It was made of red leather and it fell to bits at last, but she kept the key and gave it tome. She was most terribly poor when she died, poor old sweetie, and kept crying because she had nothing to leave me, so in the end I said I\'d rather have this little key than all the jewels in the world. I threaded it on that bit of ribbon--it was much longer then--and hung it around my neck and told her I\'d always wear it and remember her. And I did for a long time. But then the ribbon broke and I nearly lost it."&#160;&#160; <br><br>"You could have got a chain for it," said Omri.&#160;&#160; <br><br>She looked at him. "You\'re right," she said. "I should have done just that. But I didn\'t. And now it\'s your cupboard key. Please don\'t lose it, Omri, will you?"&#160;&#160; <br><br>Omri put the cupboard on his bedside table, and opening it, looked inside thoughtfully. What would he put in it? &#160; "It\'s supposed to be for medicines," said Gillon. "You could keep your nose drops in it."&#160;&#160; <br><br>"No! That\'s just wasting it. Besides, I haven\'t any other medicines."&#160;&#160; <br><br>"Why don\'t you pop this in?" his mother suggested, and opened her hand. In it was Patrick\'s Indian. "I found it when I was putting your trousers in the washing machine."&#160;&#160; <br><br>Omri carefully stood the Indian on the shelf.&#160;&#160; <br><br>"Are you going to shut the door?" asked his mother.&#160;&#160; <br><br>"Yes. And lock it." &#160; He did this and then kissed his mother and she turned the light out and he lay down on his side looking at the cupboard. He felt very content. Just as he was dropping off to sleep his eyes snapped open. He had thought he heard a little noise . . . but no. All was quiet. His eyes closed again.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br><br>In the morning there was no doubt about it. The noise actually woke him.&#160;&#160; <br><br>He lay perfectly still in the dawn light staring at the cupboard, from which was now coming a most extraordinary series of sounds. A pattering; a tapping; a scrabbling; and--surely?--a high-pitched noise like--well, almost like a tiny voice. &#160; To be truthful, Omri was petrified. Who wouldn\'t be? Undoubtedly there was something alive in that cupboard. At last, he put out his hand and touched it. He pulled very carefully. The door was shut tight. But as he pulled, the cupboard moved, just slightly.The noise from inside instantly stopped. &#160; He lay still for a long time, wondering. Had he imagined it? The noise did not start again. At last he cautiously turned the key and opened the cupboard door.&#160;&#160; <br><br>The Indian was gone.',
