      excerpt:
        "Decisions<br><br>Alanna the Lioness, the Kino Champion, could hardly contain her glee. Baron Piers of Mindeldan had written to King Jonathan to say that his daughter wished to be a page. Alanna fought to sit still as she watched Wyldon of Cavall, the royal training master, read the barons letter. Seated across his desk from them, the king watched the trainig master as sharply as his Champion did. Lord Wyldon was known for his dislike of female warriors.<br><br>It had been ten long years since the proclamation that girls might attempt a page&#8217;s training Alanna had nearly given up hope that such a girl- or the kind of family that would allow her to do so-,existed in Tortall, but at last she had come forward. Keladry of Mindelan would not have to hide her sex for eight years as Alanna had done. Keladry would prove to the world that girls could be knights. And she would not be friendless. Alanna had plans to help Keladry through the first few years. It never occurred to the Champion that anyone might object. <br><br>Alanna, half turned to see Wyldon better. Surely he'd read the letter at least twice! From this side the puffy scars from his battle to save the younger princes and princess were starkly visible; Wyldod&#8217;s right arm was in a sling yet from that fight. Alanna rubbed fingers that itched with the urge to apply healing magic. Wyldon had the idea that suffering pain made a warrior stronger. He would not thank her if she tried to heal him now. <br><br>Goddess bless, she thought tiredly. How will I ever get on with him if I'm to help this girl Keladry? <br><br>Wyldon was not flexible: he'd proved that to the entire court over and over. If he were any stiffer, Alanna thought wryly, I&#8217;d paint a design on him and use him for a shield. He's got no sense of humor and he rejects change just because it's change. <br><br>Still, she had to admit that his teaching worked. During the Immortals War of the spring and early summer, when legendary creatures had joined with the realm&#8217;s human enemies to take the kingdom, the squires and pages had been forced into battle. They had done well, thanks to their training by Wyldon and the teachers he had picked. <br><br>At last Lord Wyldon returned the letter to King Jonathan, who placed it on his desk. &quot;The baron and the baroness of Mindelan are faithful servants of the crown,&#8221; the king remarked. &#8220;We would not have this treaty with the Yamani Islands were it not for them. You will have read that their daughter received some warrior training at the Yamani court, so it would appear that Keladry has an aptitude.&quot; <br><br>Lord Wyldon resettled his arm in its sling. &quot;I did not agree to this, Your Majesty.&quot; <br><br>Alanna was about to say that he didn&#8217;t have to agree when she saw the king give the tiniest shake of the head. Clenching her jaws, she kept her remark to herself as King Jonathan raised his eyebrows. <br><br>&quot;Your predecessor agreed,&quot; he reminded Wyldon. &quot;And you, my lord, implied agreement when you accepted the post of training master.&quot; <br><br>&quot;That is a lawyer's reply, sire,&#8221; Wyldon replied stiffly, a slight flush rising in his cean-shaven cheeks. <br><br>&quot;Then here is a king's: we desire this girl to train as a page.&quot; <br><br>And that is that, Alanna thought, satisfied. She might be the kind of knight who would argue with her king, at least in private, but Wyldon would never let himself do so. <br><br>The training master absently rubbed the arm in its linen sling. At last he bowed in his chair. &quot;May we compromise, sire?&quot; <br><br>Alanna stiffened. She hated that word! &quot;Com---&quot; she began to say. <br><br>The king silenced her with a look. &quot;What do you want, my lord?&quot; <br><br>&quot;In all honesty,&quot; said the training master, thinking aloud, &quot;I had thought that our noble parents loved their daughters too much to place them in so hard a life.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Not everyone is afraid to do anything new,&quot; Alanna replied sharply. <br><br>&quot;Lioness,&quot; said the king, his voice dangerously quiet. Alanna clenched her fists. What was going on? Was Jonathan inclined to give way to the man who'd saved his children? <br><br>Wyldon's eyes met hers squarely. &quot;Your bias is known, Lady Alanna.&quot; To the king he said, &quot;Surely the girl's parents cannot be aware of the difficulties she will encounter.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Baron Piers and Lady Ilane are not fools&#8221; replied King Jonathan. &quot;They have given us three good, worthy knights already,&quot; <br><br>Lord Wyldon gave a reluctant nod. Anders, Inness, and Conal of Mindelan were credits to their training. The realm would feel the loss of Anders-whose war wounds could never heal entirely-from the active duty rolls. It would take years to replace those who were killed or maimed in the Immortals War. <br><br>&quot;Sire, please, think this through,&#8221; Wyldon said. &quot;We need the realm&#8217;s sons. Girls are fragile, more emotional, easier to frighten. They are not as strong in their arms and shoulders as men. They tire easily. This girl would get any warriors who serve with her killed on some dark night.<br><br>Alanna started to get up. This time King Jonathan walked out from behind his desk. Standing beside his Champion, he gripped one of her shoulders, keeping her in her chair. <br><br>&quot;.But I will be fair,&quot; Wyldon continued. His brown eyes were hard. &#8220;Let her be on probation for a year. By the end of the summer field camp, if she has not convinced me of her ability to keep up, she must go home.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Who judges her fitness?&quot; inquired the king. <br><br>Wyldon&#8217;s lips tightened. &quot;Who but the training master, sire? I have the most experience in evaluating the young for their roles as future knights.&quot; <br><br>Alanna turned to stare at the king. &quot;No boy has ever undergone a probationary period!&quot; she cried. <br><br>Wyldon raised his good shoulder in a shrug. &quot;Perhaps they should. For now, I will not tender my resignation over this, provided I judge whether this girl stays or goes in one year's time.&quot; <br><br>The king weighed the request. Alanna fidgeted. She knew Lord Wyldon meant his threat, and the crown needed him. Too many great nobles, dismayed by the changes in Tortall. since Jonathan&#8217;s coronation, felt that Wyldon was their voice at court. If he resigned, the king and queen would find it hard to get support for their future changes. <br><br>At last King Jonathan said, &quot;Though we do not always agree, my lord, you know I respect you because you are fair and honorable. I would hate to see that fairness, that honor, tainted in any way. Keladry of Mindelan shall have a year's probation.&quot;",

      excerpt:
        "Storm Warriors<br><br>Keladry of Mindelan lay with the comfortable black blanket of sleep wrapped around her. Then, against the blackness, light moved and strengthened to show twelve large, vaguely rat- or insectlike metal creatures, devices built for murder. The killing devices were magical machines made of iron-coated giants' bones, chains, pulleys, dagger-fingers and -toes, and a long, whiplike tail. The seven-foot-tall devices stood motionless in a half circle as the light revealed what lay at their feet: a pile of dead children. <br><br>With the devices and the bodies visible, the light spread to find the man who seemed to be the master of the creations. To Keladry of Mindelan, known as Kel, he was the Nothing Man. He was almost two feet shorter than the killing devices, long-nosed and narrow-mouthed, with small, rapidly blinking eyes and dull brown hair. His dark robe was marked with stains and burns; his hair was unkempt. He always gnawed a fingernail, or scratched a pimple, or shifted from foot to foot. <br><br>Once that image-devices, bodies, man-was complete, Kel woke. She stared at the shadowed ceiling and cursed the Chamber of the Ordeal. The Chamber had shown Kel this vision, or variations of it, after her formal Ordeal of knighthood. As far as Kel knew, no one else had been given any visions of people to be found once a squire was knighted. As everyone she knew understood it, the Ordeal was straightforward enough. The Chamber forced would-be knights to live through their fears. If they did this without making a sound, they were released, to be proclaimed knights, and that was the end of the matter. <br><br>Kel was different. Three or four times a week, the Chamber sent her this dream. It was a reminder of the task it had set her. After her Ordeal, before the Chamber set her free, it had shown her the killing devices, the Nothing Man, and the dead children. It had demanded that Kel stop it all. <br><br>Kel guessed that the Nothing Man would be in Scanra, to the north, since the killing devices had appeared during Scanran raids on Tortall last summer. Trapped in the capital by a hard winter, with travel to the border nearly impossible, Kel had lived with growing tension. She had to ride north as soon as the mountain passes opened if she was to sneak into Scanra and begin her search for the Nothing Man. Every moment she remained in Tortall invited the growing risk that the king would issue orders to most knights, including Kel, to defend the northern border. The moment Kel got those orders, she would be trapped. She had vowed to defend the realm and obey its monarchs, which would mean fighting soldiers, not hunting for a mage whose location was unknown. <br><br>&quot;Maybe I'll get lucky. Maybe I'll ride out one day and find there's a line of killing devices from the palace right up to the Nothing Man's door,&quot; she grumbled, easing herself out from under her covers. Kel never threw off her blankets. With a number of sparrows and her dog sharing her bed, she might smother a friend if she hurried. Even taking care, she heard muffled cheeps of protest. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she told her companions, and set her feet on the cold flagstones of her floor. <br><br>She made her way across her dark room and opened the shutters on one of her windows. Before her lay a courtyard and a stable where the men of the King's Own kept their horses. The torches that lit the courtyard were nearly out. The pearly radiance that came to the eastern sky in the hour before dawn fell over snow, stable, and the edges of the palace wall beyond. <br><br>The scant light showed a big girl of eighteen, broadshouldered and solid-waisted, with straight mouse-brown hair cut short below her earlobes and across her forehead. She had a dreamer's hazel eyes, set beneath long, curling lashes, odd in contrast to the many fine scars on her hands and the muscles that flexed and bunched under her nightshirt. Her nose was still unbroken and delicate after eight years of palace combat training, her lips full and quicker to smile than frown. Determination filled every inch of her strong body. <br><br>Motion in the shadows at the base of the courtyard wall caught her eye. Kel gasped as a winged creature waddled out into the open courtyard, as ungainly on its feet as a vulture. The flickering torchlight caught and sparked along the edges of metal feathers on wings and legs. Steel legs, flexible and limber, ended in steel-clawed feet. Between the metal wings and above the metal legs and feet was human flesh, naked, hairless, grimy, and in this case, male. <br><br>The Stormwing looked at Kel and grinned, baring sharp steel teeth. His face was lumpy and unattractive, marked by a large nose, small eyes, and a thin upper lip with a full lower one. He had the taunting smile of someone born impudent. &quot;Startle you, did I?&#8221; he inquired. <br><br>Kel thanked the gods that the cold protected her sensitive nose, banishing most of the Stormwing's foul stench. Stormwings loved battlefields, where they tore corpses to pieces, urinated on them, smeared them with dung, then rolled in the mess. The result was a nauseating odor that made even the strongest stomach rebel. Her teachers had explained that the purpose of Stormwings was to make people think twice before they chose to fight, knowing what might happen to the dead when Stormwings arrived. So far they hadn't done much good as far as Kel could see: people still fought battles and killed each other, Stormwings or no. Tortall&#8217;s Stormwing population was thriving. But this was the first time she'd seen one on palace grounds. <br><br>Kel glared at him. <br>&#8220;Get out of here, you nasty thing!

      excerpt:
        "PAGE KELADRY<br><br>Fall that year was warm. Heat lay in a blanket over the basin of the River Olorun, where the capital of Tortall covered the banks. No breath of air stirred the pennants and flags on their poles. The river itself was a band of glass, without a breeze anywhere to ruffle its shinning surface. Traffic in the city moved as if the air were thick honey No one with sense cared to rush. <br><br>Behind the royal palace, eleven-year-old Keladry of Mindelan stared at the rising ground that led from the training yards to the pages' wing and decided that she had no sense. She felt as if she'd let people beat her with mallets all morning. Surely it was too hot for her to do as she normally did -run up that hill to reach her rooms and bathe. After all, she would be the only one to know if she walked today. <br><br>Who would think this cursed harness would make such a difference? she wondered, reaching under her canvas practice coat to finger broad leather straps. At some point during her first year as page, she had learned that second-, third-, and fourth-years wore weighted- harnesses, and that more weights were -added every four months, but she had never considered it in terms of herself Now she wished that she had donned something of the kind in the empty summer months, when she made the daily trek to the palace to keep up her training. If she had, she wouldn&#8217;t ache so much now. <br><br>She wiped her sleeve over her forehead. It's not even like you're carrying a lot - of weight, she scolded herself. Eight little disks- maybe two pounds in lead. You trained last year and all summer with lead-weighted weapons, just to build your strength. <i>This</i> can&#8217;t be that different! <br><br>But it was. Hand-to-hand combat, staff work, archery, and riding took extra effort with two pounds of lead hanging on her shoulders, chest, and back. I've got to run, she told herself wearily. If I don&#8217;t move soon, I'll be late to wash and late to lunch, and Lord Wy1don will give me punishment work. So heat or no, I have to go up that hill. I may as well run it. <br><br>She waited a moment more, steeling herself. She hated this run. That slowly rising ground was torture on her legs even last spring, when she'd been running it off and on for more than half a year. <br><br>No stranger, looking at her, would have thought this disheveled girl was the sort to cause a storm of argument at court. She had a dreamer's quiet hazel eyes, framed in long lashes, and plain brown hair that she wore cropped as short as a boy's. Her nose was small and delicate, her skin tan and dusted with freckles. She was big for a girl of eleven, five feet three inches tall and solidly built. Only someone who looked closely at her calm face would detect a spark in her level gaze, and determination in her mouth and chin. <br><br>At last she groaned and began to trot up the hill. Her path took her behind the mews, the kennels, and the forges. Men and women in palace livery and servants' garb waved as she ran past. A woman told some kennel workers, &quot;Looka here- tol' ya she'd be back!&quot; <br><br>Kel smiled through pouring sweat. No one had thought that the old-fashioned training master would allow the first-known girl page in over a century to stay after her first year. When Lord WyIdon surprised the world and allowed Kel to stay, many had assumed Kel would &quot;come to her senses&quot; and drop out over the summer holiday. <br><br>You&#8217;d think by now they'd know I won't quit, she thought as she toiled on up the hill. <br><br>She was lurching when she reached the kitchen gardens, her shortcut to the pages' wing. There she had to catch her breath. An upended bucket did for a seat. She inhaled the scents of marjoram, sage, and thyme, massaging her calf muscles. For the hundredth time she wished she could use the palace baths as the boys did, instead of having to go all the way to her room to wash up. <br><br>&quot;Hi! You!&quot; cried a male voice from the direction -of the kitchens. &quot;Come back with those sausages!&quot; <br><br>Kel got to her feet. A cook raced out of the kitchen, waving a meat cleaver. Empty beanpoles, stripped after the harvest, went flying as he crashed through them. Metal flashed as the cleaver chopped through the air. The man doubled back and ran on, plainly chasing something far smaller than he. Once he stumbled; once he dropped the cleaver. On he came, cursing. <br><br>The dog he pursued raced toward Kel. A string of fat sausages hung from his jaws. With a last burst of speed, the animal ducked behind Kel. <br><br>The cook charged them, cleaver raised. &quot;I'll kill YOU this time!&quot; he screeched, face crimson with fury. <br><br>Kel put her hands on her hips. &quot;Me or the dog?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Out of the way, page!&quot; he snarled, circling to her left. &quot;He's stolen his last meal!&quot; <br><br>As she turned to keep herself between the man and his prey, Kel glanced behind her. The dog huddled by her seat, gobbling his catch. <br><br>&quot;Stop right there,&quot; Kel ordered the man. <br><br>&quot;Move, or I'll report this to my lord Wyldon,&quot; he snapped. &quot;I'll get that mongrel good and proper!&quot; <br><br>Kel gathered dog and sausages up in her arms. &quot;You1l do no such thing,&quot; she retorted. The dog, knowing what was important, continued to gorge. <br><br>&quot;You'll hand that animal over now, my lad, if you know what's right,&#8221; the servant told her. &quot;He's naught but a thieving stray. He's got to be stopped.&quot; <br><br>&quot;With a meat cleaver?&quot; demanded Kel. <br><br>&quot;If that's what it takes.&#8221;<br><br>No,&quot; she said flatly. &quot;No killing. I'll see to it the dog doesn't steal from you.&quot; <br>&quot;Sausages is worth money! Who's to pay for them? Not me!&quot; <br><br>Kel reached instinctively for her belt and sighed, impatient with herself She didn't wear her purse with training clothes. &quot;Go to Salma Aynnar, In charge of the pages' wing,&quot; she said loftily. &quot;Tell her Keladry of Mindelan requests that she pay you the cost of these sausages from my pocket money. And you'd better not overcharge her,&quot; she added. <br><br>&quot;Kel ... Oh, Mithros's&quot;- he looked at her and changed what he'd been about to say-&quot;shield. You're the girl. Being softhearted will do you no good, mistress,&quot; he informed her. &quot;Be sure I'll get my money. And if I see that animal here again&#8221; -he pointed at Kel's armful-&quot;I'll chop him up for cat-meat, see if I won't!&quot; <br><br>He thrust his cleaver into his belt and stomped back to the kitchens, muttering. Kel adjusted her hold on the dog and his prize and headed for the pages' wing. &quot;We aren&#8217;t allowed pets, you know,&quot; she informed her passenger. &quot;With my luck, all those sausages will make you sick, and I'll have to clean it up.&quot; She passed through an open door into the cool stone halls of the palace. As she trotted along, she examined her armful. <br><br>The dog's left car was only a tatter. He was gray-white for the most part; black splotches adorned the end of his nose, hi&#167;- only whole ear, and his rump. The rest of him was scars, healing scrapes, and staring ribs. His sausages eaten, he peered up into her face with two small, black, triangular eyes and licked her. His tail, broken in two places and healed crookedly, beat her arm. <br><br>&quot;I am not your friend,&quot; Kel said as she reached her door.",

      excerpt:
        "Despite the overflow of humanity present for the congress at the royal palace, the hall where Keladry of Mimdelan walked was deserted. There were no servants to be seen. No echo of the footsteps, laughter, or talk that filled the sprawling residence sounded here, only Kel's steps and the click of her dog's claws on the stone floor. <br><br>They made an interesting pair. The fourteen-year-old girl was big for her age, five feet nine inches tall, and dressed informally in breeches and shirt. Both were a dark green that emphasized the same color in her green-hazel eyes. Her dark boots were comfortable, not fashionable. On her belt hung a pouch and a black-hilted dagger in a plain black sheath. Her brown hair was cut to earlobe length. It framed a tanned face dusted with freckles across a delicate nose. Her mouth was full and decided. <br><br>The dog, known as Jump, was barrel-chested, with slightly bowed forelegs. His small, triangular eyes were set deep in a head shaped like a heavy chisel. He was mostly white, but black splotches covered the end of his nose, his lone whole ear, and his rump; his tail plainly had been broken twice. He looked like a battered foot soldier to Kel's young squire, and he had proved his combat skills often. <br><br>At the end of the hall stood a pair of wooden doors carved with a sun, the symbol of Mithros, god of law and war. They were ancient, the surfaces around the sun curved deep after centuries of polishing. Their handles were crude iron, as coarse as the fittings on a barn door. <br><br>Kel stopped. Of the pages who had just passed the great examinations to become squires, she was the only one who had not come here before. Pages never came to this hall. Legend held that pages who visited the Chapel of the Ordeal never became squires: they were disgraced or killed. But once they were squires, the temptation to see the place where they would be tested on their fitness for knighthood was irresistible. <br><br>Kel reached for the handle, and opened one door just enough to admit her and Jump. There were benches placed on either side of the room from the door to the altar. Kel slid onto one, glad to give her wobbly knees a rest. Jump sat in the aisle beside her. <br><br>After her heart calmed, Kel inspected her surroundings. This chapel, focus of so many longings, was plain. The floor was gray stone flags; the benches were polished wood without ornament. Windows set high in the walls on either side were as stark as the room itself. <br><br>Ahead was the altar. Here, at least, was decoration: gold candlesticks and an altar cloth that looked like gold chain mail. The sun disk on the wall behind it was also gold. Against the gray stone, the dark benches, and the wrought-iron cressets on the walls, the gold looked tawdry. <br><br>The iron door to the right of the sun disk drew Kel's eyes. There was the Chamber of the Ordeal. Generations of squires had entered it to experience something. None told what they saw; they were forbidden to speak of it. Whatever it was, it usually let squires return to the chapel to be knighted. <br><br>Some who entered the Chamber failed. A year-mate of Kel's brother Anders had died three weeks after his Ordeal without ever speaking. Two years after that a squire from Fief Yanholm left the Chamber, refused his shield, and fled, never to be seen again. At Midwinter in 453, months before the Immortals War broke out, a squire went mad there. Five months later he escaped his family and drowned himself <br><br>&#8221;The Chamber is like a cutter of gemstones,&quot; Anders had told Kel once. &quot;It looks for your flaws and hammers them, till you crack open. And that's all I-or anyone will say about it.&quot; <br><br>The iron door seemed almost separate from the wall, more real than its surroundings. Kel got to her feet, hesitated, then went to it. Standing before the door, she felt a cold draft. <br><br>Kel wet suddenly dry lips with her tongue. Jump whined. &quot;I know what I'm doing,&#8221; she told her dog without conviction, and set her palm on the door. <br><br><i>She sat at a desk, stacks of Parchment on either side. Her hands sharpened a goose quill with a penknife. Splotches of ink stained her fingers. Even her sleeves were spotted with &quot;There you are, squire.&quot; <br><br>Kel looked up. Before her stood Sir Gareth the Younger, King <br>Jonathan's friend and adviser. Like Kel's, his hands and sleeves were ink-stained. &#8220;I need you to find these.&#8221; He passed a slate to Kel, who took it, her throat tight with misery. &quot;Before you finish up today, please. They should be in section eighty-eight.&quot; He pointed to the far end of the room. She saw shelves, all stretching from floor to ceiling, al lstuffed with books, scrolls, and documents. <br><br>She looked at her tunic. She wore the badge Fief Naxen, Sir Gareth's home, with the white ring around it that indicated she served the heir to the fief. Her knight-master was a desk knight, not a warrior. <br><br>Work is work, she thought, trying not to cry. She still had her duty to Sir Gareth, even if  it meant grubbing through papers. She thrust herself away ftom her desk-<br><br></i>-and tottered on the chapel's flagstones. Her hands were numb with cold, her palms bright red where they had touched the Chamber door. <br><br>Kel scowled at the iron door. &quot;I'll do my duty,&quot; she told the thing, shivering. <br><br>Jump whined again. He peered up at her, his tail awag in consolation. <br><br>&quot;I'm all right,&quot; Kel reassured him, but she checked her hands for inkspots. The Chamber had made her live the thing she feared most just now, when no field knight had asked for her service. What if the Chamber knew? What if she was to spend the next four years copying out dry passages from drier records? Would she quit? Would paperwork do what other pages' hostility had not-drive her back to Mindelan?",

        "LYRA didn&#8217;t often climb out of her bedroom window these days. She had a better way onto the roof of Jordan College: the Porter had given her a key that let her onto the roof of the Lodge Tower. He&#8217;d let her have it because he was too old to climb the steps and check the stonework and the lead, as was his duty four times a year; so she made a full report to him, and he passed it to the Bursar, and in exchange she was able to get out onto the roof whenever she wanted. When she lay down on the lead, she was invisible from everywhere except the sky. A little parapet ran all the way around the square roof, and Pantalaimon often draped his pine-marten form over the mock battlements on the corner facing south, and dozed while Lyra sat below with her back against the sun-drenched stone, studying the books she&#8217;d brought up with her. Sometimes they&#8217;d stop and watch the storks that nested on St. Michael&#8217;s Tower, just across Turl Street. Lyra had a plan to tempt them over to Jordan, and she&#8217;d even dragged several planks of wood up to the roof and laboriously nailed them together to make a platform, just as they&#8217;d done at St. Michael&#8217;s; but it hadn&#8217;t worked. The storks were loyal to St. Michael&#8217;s, and that was that. <br>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t stay for long if we kept on coming here, anyway,&#8221; said Pantalaimon.<br>&#8220;We could tame them. I bet we could. What do they eat?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Fish,&#8221; he guessed. &#8220;Frogs.&#8221; He was lying on top of the stone parapet, lazily grooming his red gold fur. Lyra stood up to lean on the stone beside him, her limbs full of warmth, and gazed out toward the southeast, where a dusty dark-green line of trees rose above the spires and rooftops in the early evening air.<br><br>She was waiting for the starlings. That year an extraordinary number of them had come to roost in the Botanic Garden, and every evening they would rise out of the trees like smoke, and swirl and swoop and dart through the skies above the city in their thousands.<br>&#8220;Millions,&#8221; Pan said.<br>&#8220;Maybe, easily. I don&#8217;t know who could ever count them. . . . There they are!&#8221; They didn&#8217;t seem like individual birds, or even individual dots of black against the blue; it was the flock itself that was the individual. It was like a single piece of cloth, cut in a very complicated way that let it swing through itself and double over and stretch and fold in three dimensions without ever tangling, turning itself inside out and elegantly waving and crossing through and falling and rising and falling again. &#8220;If it was saying something . . . ,&#8221; said Lyra.<br>&#8220;Like signaling.&#8221;<br>&#8220;No one would know, though. No one could ever understand what it meant.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Maybe it means nothing. It just is.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Everything means something,&#8221; Lyra said severely. &#8220;We just have to find out how to read it.&#8221; Pantalaimon leapt across a gap in the parapet to the stone in the corner, and stood on his hind legs, balancing with his tail and gazing more intently at the vast swirling flock over the far side of the city.<br>&#8220;What does that mean, then?&#8221; he said. She knew exactly what he was referring to. She was watching it too. Something was jarring or snagging at the smokelike, flaglike, ceaseless motion of the starlings, as if that miraculous multidimensional cloth had found itself unable to get rid of a knot.<br>&#8220;They&#8217;re attacking something,&#8221; Lyra said, shading her eyes. And coming closer. Lyra could hear them now, too: a high-pitched angry mindless shriek. The bird at the center of the swirling anger was darting to right and left, now speeding upward, now dropping almost to the rooftops, and when it was no closer than the spire of the University Church, and before they could even see what kind of bird it was, Lyra and Pan found themselves shaking with surprise. For it wasn&#8217;t a bird, although it was bird-shaped; it was a d&#230;mon. A witch&#8217;s d&#230;mon.<br>&#8220;Has anyone else seen it? Is anyone looking?&#8221; said Lyra. Pan&#8217;s black eyes swept every rooftop, every window in sight, while Lyra leaned out and looked up and down the street on one side and then darted to the other three sides to look into Jordan&#8217;s front quadrangle and along the roof as well. The citizens of Oxford were going about their daily business, and a noise of birds in the sky wasn&#8217;t interesting enough to disturb them. Just as well: because a d&#230;mon was instantly recognizable as what he was, and to see one without his human would have caused a sensation, if not an outcry of fear and horror. &#8220;Oh, this way, this way!&#8221; Lyra said urgently, unwilling to shout, but jumping up and waving both arms; and Pan too was trying to attract the d&#230;mon&#8217;s attention, leaping from stone to stone, flowing across the gaps and spinning around to leap back again. The birds were closer now, and Lyra could see the d&#230;mon clearly: a dark bird about the size of a thrush, but with long arched wings and a forked tail. Whatever he&#8217;d done to anger the starlings, they were possessed by fear and rage, swooping, stabbing, tearing, trying to batter him out of the air.<br>&#8220;This way! Here, here!&#8221; Pan cried, and Lyra flung open the trapdoor to give the d&#230;mon a way of escape. The noise, now that the starlings were nearly overhead, was deafening, and Lyra thought that people below must be looking up to see this war in the sky. And there were so many birds, as thick as flakes in a blizzard of black snow, that Lyra, her arm across her head, lost sight of the d&#230;mon among them. But Pan had him. As the d&#230;mon-bird dived low toward the tower, Pan stood up on his hind legs, and then leapt up to gather the d&#230;mon in his paws and roll with him over and over toward the trapdoor, and they fell through clumsily as Lyra struck out with her fists to left and right and then tumbled through after the two d&#230;mons, dragging the trapdoor shut behind her.",

        "What makes Icky Ricky so icky? Well, there was this time, for example . . .<br><br>Chapter #1<br>HOMEWORK CHEESE and THE BOOGER BUBBLE FREAKOUT<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Starring<br>THE NOT-SO-SAFE WATERMELON BIKE HELMET!<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Yesterday, Gus came over to my house and wanted to go bike riding. I couldn't find my bike helmet. So instead of wasting time looking for it, I decided to make a helmet.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I brought a watermelon from the kitchen out to the front steps. I cut it in half with a plastic knife because I'm not allowed to use real knives and that took forever. Then I scooped out all of the insides. I put the watermelon on my head. It looked really cool. I had an awesome bike helmet, even though it was all drippy and stuff. Then Gus wanted a watermelon helmet, too. So we made his from the other half of the watermelon.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We didn't know if the helmets were safe for bike riding, so we tested them. We dropped things on them, like a book, splop! And a shoe, clomp! And a wrench, blonk! And then a really big book, kasplop! Then we did one more test. We ran into a wall as hard as we could.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Wham! <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Splop!</i> The helmets cracked, and the juices and gunk ran all over our faces. We couldn't go bike riding.<br>But all of that testing had made us hungry. We went back to the steps and scraped all of the watermelon insides into a bowl. But there were ants in it now, and a leaf and a stick. I don't eat ants. (It's not fair to them.) We let the ants have the watermelon, and we picked out the seeds.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We decided to have a watermelon seed-spitting contest.",

It was a bit dark and cloudy, but it wasn't raining. We started running down the street, but Gus said he didn't like passing the house with the freaky man-dog. It's a dog that lost some fur around his eyes, so around his eyes it's kind of skin-colored, and it looks like a man wearing a dog mask. So we turned around and went the other way. But Stew said he doesn't like going that way because of the one-eyed squirrel. There really is a one eyed squirrel that lives in a tree or something, and it's the meanest squirrel ever. Once I saw it snatch a cookie right out of a kid's hand!<br>&#160;&#160; We ended up taking a small path that leads between the houses. We followed the little stream back there, and finally came out on the next block. We had about six blocks to go when we saw some lightning, and then boom! There was this huge thunder explosion! Then it started raining like crazy. I held the pizza box over my head so I could stay dry. We ran to find someplace to get out of the rain.<br>&#160;&#160; Then Gus screamed \"One-eyed squirrel!\" and he pointed to something in the trees.<br>&#160;&#160; And I was like, \"He wants the pizza!\"<br>&#160;&#160; Stew said, \"Run!\"",

      excerpt:
        'The sound was stabbing, slicing, shivering, like metal scraping against stone. Eragon\'s teeth vibrated in sympathy, and he covered his ears with his hands, grimacing as he twisted around, trying to locate the source of the noise. Saphira tossed her head, and even through the din, he heard her whine in distress. <br><br>Eragon swept his gaze over the courtyard twice before he noticed a faint puff of dust rising up the wall of the keep from a foot-wide crack that had appeared beneath the blackened, partially destroyed window where Bl&ouml;dhgarm had killed the magician. As the squeal increased in intensity, Eragon risked lifting a hand off one ear to point at the crack. <br><br>"Look!" he shouted to Arya, who nodded in acknowledgment. He replaced his hand over his ear. <br><br>Without warning or preamble, the sound stopped.<br><br>Eragon waited for a moment, then slowly lowered his hands, for once wishing that his hearing was not quite so sensitive. <br><br>Just as he did, the crack jerked open wider--spreading until it was several feet across--and raced down the wall of the keep. Like a bolt of lightning, the crack struck and shattered the keystone above the door to the building, showering the floor below with pebble-sized rocks. The whole castle groaned, and from the damaged window to the broken keystone, the front of the keep began to lean outward. <br><br>"Run!" Eragon shouted at the Varden, though the men were already scattering to either side of the courtyard, desperate to get out from under the precarious wall. Eragon took a single step forward, every muscle in his body tense as he searched for a glimpse of Roran somewhere in the throng of warriors. <br><br>At last Eragon spotted him, trapped behind the last group of men by the doorway, bellowing madly at them, his words lost in the commotion. Then the wall shifted and dropped several inches, leaning even farther away from the rest of the building, pelting Roran with rocks, knocking him off balance and forcing him to stumble backward under the overhang of the doorway. <br><br>As Roran straightened from a crouch, his eyes met Eragon\'s, and in his gaze, Eragon saw a flash of fear and helplessness, quickly followed by resignation, as if Roran knew that, no matter how fast he ran, he could not possibly reach safety in time. <br><br>A wry smile touched Roran\'s lips. <br><br>And the wall fell. <br><br><br>Text &#169; 2011 by Christopher Paolini.',

      excerpt:
        "Chapter One<br>My parents bought me a dolphin when I was twelve, but I made them take her back.<br>They led me through the backyard of our huge new house, my mom's hands over my eyes, my dad's hands on my shoulders leading me forward; then they stopped in front of the pool, threw their hands in the air, and yelled, \"Surprise! She's yours!\" That was during those first few heady years after the win when they were still figuring out what money could buy and what it shouldn't.<br>My breath caught as I watched the dolphin's sleek steel-gray body fly through the length of our pool. Something awful twisted in the pit of my stomach as I saw this powerful predator trapped in our silly man-made folly. Instead of the giddy, excited birthday girl they were expecting, my parents got a full-blown fit. Livid and horrified, I made them call the marine-animal rescue program to come get her. My parents had to talk fast to explain why they had a dolphin in their backyard pool. But since their call also came with an extremely generous donation for the future care of my dolphin, they never got in trouble, even though it was illegal to keep a dolphin in a home pool.<br>The rest of the afternoon could best be described as grim. While we waited for the rescue team to arrive, we sat on the patio overlooking the pool with my dolphin swimming in frantic circles like a moth trapped in a glass jar. I couldn't bring myself to eat my cake-shaped like a dolphin, covered in unappetizing bright-blue icing that was rapidly melting in the sun. A few hours later, the rescue team came and loaded the dolphin into a special carrier lined with a foam mattress fitted for the dolphin's body and sprayers to keep her sensitive skin from drying out.<br>Silently we watched the dolphin get carted away. I could feel my parents' disappointment and disapproval like a heavy weight. Even my brother and sister thought I was being ridiculously self-righteous. But it wasn't that I didn't want my own personal dolphin; I wanted to keep her so badly that I cried myself to sleep after she left.<br>I had posters of humpback whales and the Greenpeace ships that fought to save them like other girls my age had posters of movie stars. What ocean-crazy girl wouldn't adore swimming with her own pet dolphin? I could see why they had gotten confused.<br>I was only twelve but I knew she could never be mine. An internal compass triggered an alarm that blared: No! It would be evil to keep her.<br>Which is how five years later, as soon as my sister bursts through the tea shop's front door, I immediately know something is very wrong. My internal clock is ringing like a bell. As soon as I see her face, the mad and terrified look in her eyes, I shiver and know something very bad has happened. Something that money can't fix.<br>As it turns out, I'm half-right.<br><br>Chapter Two<br>I finish brewing two citrus green teas for an older couple with a baby in one of those strange new strollers, when the door flies open and my sister enters her shop, Steeped. I almost don't recognize her. From my view behind the counter, Natasha's blood-red pashmina flutters behind her like a demon's wings. Natasha's trips to Tennessee to visit her ex-boyfriend, Emmett, never turn out well for any of us, but this expression frozen on her face, this level of anguish, is new.<br>The door swings shut with a sweet little tinkle as the silver bell dances on its string. So an entrance fit for slamming doors and a gong of doom makes do with the calm, Zen-like atmosphere of the shop. Natasha spares a quick glance around, her pale eyes taking in the merchandise on the shelves, the swept floors, the inviting groupings of chairs and small tables. For all her drama and unpredictability, Natasha is a fine and responsible business owner. But she's off her game. As she comes toward me, she brushes by the couple heading out with their drinks. They give her a funny look and exchange glances the way you do when you pass a crazy person; then they hurry out of the shop as if to get their baby away from danger. I gaze after them, wishing I could follow.<br>Natasha lifts the partition and steps behind the counter, the air around her oddly dark and heavy. Natasha is often intense, charming when it suits her, horrid when it doesn't. But whatever her mood is, it usually makes sense. This doesn't. There's something unreadable in her face. As she steps near me, I wrinkle my nose. Even the way she smells is off.<br>\"Tasha,\" I say. \"You okay?\"<br>She ignores the question.<br>\"Shop's been good?\" she asks, her voice oddly raspy and subdued. She's been gone nearly two weeks, the longest she's been away since she opened the store almost five years ago.<br>\"Yeah.\" I nod cautiously. \"Pretty typical.\" When Natasha makes an impatient little motion for me to go on, I add, \"There's a knitting group that wants to host their monthly meetings here. Thursday evenings. I said it was probably fine, but that I'd check with you.\"<br>She has a manager for the shop, a creep named John Parker, but she likes me to keep an eye on it while she's gone. I don't let Natasha pay me, though she's offered more than once. I like feeling like the shop is my second home, and you can't clock in and out for pay in your second home. You can, however, help yourself to tea and blueberry scones.<br>Natasha's annual buying trips usually finish with a visit to her ex in Tennessee, an old high school boyfriend and the only guy she's ever been in love with. After they broke up, she lent him the money to open his tattoo shop. Anyone else and it would be sweet, friendship after romance. Cynically, I saw it as less of a generous gesture than an iron-proof way to force him to answer to her. She wasn't visiting Emmett because her feelings mellowed into friendship. She went there for the same reason she lent him money in the first place, because she's never given up on getting him back.<br>As she makes her way around the counter, I expect her to brew up a pot of gunpowder tea and then go over the books, or review inventory, see what's running low and needs reordering. After she's gone, foul mood or no, she always wants to know every last detail of what she missed while she was gone.<br>Instead, she says, \"Thanks, Leni,\" and then keeps going, through the beaded curtain to her small office in the back. Before I can ask how her trip was and figure out what's wrong, she shuts the door behind her with a firm click.<br>The air-conditioning kicks on and a cool breeze blows across my neck, making me squirm.<br>Half an hour later the office door's still closed. I press my ear against Natasha's shut door but there's nothing besides the flutes.<br>\"Tasha? What's wrong?\" I say to the wood-paneled door.<br>Silence. No answer.<br>\"Natasha, what happened?\" I try the handle but it's locked.<br>An inexplicable rush of dread comes over me. For a terrible second, when there is nothing, no reply, no sound at all, I think maybe she's dead. Which is ridiculous and I'm not one prone to crazy flights of imagination. But there was something so wrong about her, something broken.<br>I thump into the door with my shoulder, trying to force it open. It remains solidly closed. I rub my shoulder. There's still no sound coming from inside the room. Nothing. My irrational/rational fear grows, and everything I learned in that survival course from four years ago comes rushing back, along with a welcome shot of adrenaline. As I step into a fighting position, my muscles bunch, ready to explode with a powerful front kick aimed left of the locked handle. But then I hear rustling and stop myself in time, tripping forward a bit to stop the momentum.<br>\"Natasha,\" I bellow, pounding the door and rattling the handle. \"Let me in!\"<br>There's more rustling and eventually the click of the lock. The ceramic handle turns under my hand. And there she is, small and haggard, blotchy skin with, I could swear, a tinge of green to it.<br>My sister is the beautiful one in the family, creamy white skin, long dark hair with deep glints of burgundy. My hair is lighter, bleached from too much time in the sun, my skin darker, tanned from hours spent kayaking on the bay. We have the same color eyes, greenish, bluish gray. On me they sort of blend in with whatever I'm standing next to, like a chameleon. On Natasha, they glow. After she got the massive tattoo of a Japanese scroll across her back a few years ago, she only wore long, backless dresses, and coming or going she made you catch your breath.<br>She's taken off her red shawl and is wearing her signature backless dress, water-colored silk in blues and greens, except without her high heels the long skirt puddles around her feet and she looks like a child playing dress-up.<br>\"Natasha,\" I say, confusion and worry mingling. \"What happened?\"<br>Her eyes pool with tears at the soft question. My sister never cries. Curses, screams in rage, laughs out loud, rolls her eyes, and shoots death-ray glares, yes. Pathetic weeping? Not so much. I shake my head as if to clear it.<br>Natasha's ex-boyfriend is a big guy. He's the one who did the tattoo, and he has been the object of her obsessive love since she was fifteen. I quickly scan her bare arms, the deep V of her dress, for bruises or marks. He never struck me as the violent type, but maybe Natasha's nine-year obsessive crush finally drove him over the edge.<br>\"What did Emmett do to you?\"<br>\"It wasn't him.\" Her tears spill over. \"He didn't do anything.\"<br>The silver bell hanging from the front door tinkles musically.<br>Steeped is perfectly located on a busy thoroughfare with a beautiful view of the bay, which means there's usually a steady stream of customers. We were lucky to have ten minutes without interruption. I glance over my shoulder through the beaded curtain. There's a guy studying the giant menu over the counter.<br>\"Be right with you,\" I call. Then I give Natasha a stern look. \"Wash your face. Then tell me what the heck happened to you.\" She flinches at my tone but turns and slowly makes her way to the restrooms.<br>I hurry to the customer, in his midthirties with funky purple wire glasses and auburn highlights. He asks about our chai; we carry three kinds.<br>\"They're all good.\" I keep listening for Natasha, expecting her to pop back out, take charge like she always does. \"It depends what you're in the mood for.\" Seeing that this isn't going to speed things along, I interrupt his internal debate. \"I prefer the Indian masala chai. We ship it directly from India. We're the first tea shop in America to carry this blend.\"<br>That little speech always seals the deal and sure enough, I'm soon brewing an order of Indian masala chai.<br>Before I can head back to crisis-manage my sister, a couple of girls my age walk in. One looks familiar and when she keeps looking at me, I know with a sinking feeling that we must have gone to school together.<br>My parents used to send me to the fanciest, most expensive school in St. Petersburg. That was actually how they made their decision. They looked at the tuition of all the private schools in the area and chose the highest one.<br>I hated St. John's. I hated the brand-new cars in the parking lot, the five-hundred-dollar purses the girls carried, the expensive haircuts. I even hated the teachers, with their eager faces, their anxious desire for their students to succeed and to like them. So after I overheard my parents argue about money, the first such fight in five years, I quietly applied to South St. Pete's Citrus Park High, the science magnet high school, known for its terrific marine-science program and ghetto location. Once I was accepted, I came to my parents and begged to switch.<br>I should have realized that things were getting bad, and fast, when with very little begging and pleading on my part, my parents let me transfer and attend a school at the edge of one of the worst neighborhoods in the city, where a little girl had died in a drive-by shooting a few months earlier and two policemen were killed in the line of duty a couple of years back.<br>I don't regret switching schools but it's never fun bumping into former St. John's schoolmates. Somehow, they always manage to convey that by leaving the school to go to a public high school, I was no longer \"one of them.\" These two are no different. After an awkward little visit down not-so-fond memory lane, I take their order, serve them and send them on their way.<br>The moment they're out the door, I hurry to my sister's office. Her back is to me, head resting on her folded arms at her desk. She's usually very aware of her tattoo, of her body, and like a model she always makes sure she's displayed in the best light, at the best angle. In this position, though, Natasha's curved spine puts the tattoo in stark relief, the Japanese characters stretched out. It's not a good pose for her.<br>A horrible thought occurs to me.<br>\"Natasha, are you pregnant?\"<br>\"What?\" Her head snaps back to stare at me. \"Don't be an idiot.\"<br>I let out a breath I wasn't aware I was holding. Natasha procreating. I shudder. The world is not ready.<br>\"Leni,\" she says, her voice cracking. \"You can't even imagine, you can't . . .\" She loses her train of thought and her eyes focus on something over my shoulder. Instinctively, I look behind me, but there is nothing there.<br>\"Your birthday's coming up,\" she says suddenly.<br>\"Yeah,\" I say, wary about this change of topic. \"The big one-eight.\"<br>My birthday is in nine days and Natasha has already offered the shop to host the party. The gala, as my parents keep calling it. It's a joke of epic proportions to think of hosting a gala for my eighteenth birthday. It's only with the free use of space and Natasha's wholesale contacts that it's even conceivable, and even so it seems like a colossal waste of money. I told my parents that I would rather they tally up how much they were planning to spend and make a donation in my name to a couple of organizations that work to protect Tampa Bay, but they laughed me off and said they'd do both.",

      excerpt:
        "Chapter 1<br>Illness in the House<br>Maine<br>On May 23, exactly one month before Gustavia and Leomaris Brennan&rsquo;s eleventh birthday, their mother became terribly, mysteriously ill.<br>At first, it was quite a wonderful day. For one thing, it was a Saturday, which meant sleeping in, at least for Leo. Gus could never sleep in, so she hopped out of bed at her usual time and ran down to the kitchen, where she found her father mixing batter for pancakes.<br>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; Gus said. Her dad murmured back as he peered into his mixing bowl. Ila said nothing, but she smiled up at Gus from her bowl of oatmeal, the only breakfast she would eat.<br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mom?&rdquo; Gus asked.<br>&ldquo;Not feeling well,&rdquo; her father said lightly. &ldquo;I figured I&rsquo;d let her sleep. I don&rsquo;t have to go into the lab today anyway. Let&rsquo;s go wake up that brother of yours.&rdquo;<br>Ila jumped up and grabbed her bowl of oatmeal off the table to follow them.<br>&ldquo;Food at the table, Ila,&rdquo; their father said. Ila gave him her Please? smile, and he shook his head in defeat. &ldquo;OK, but two hands and no juice.&rdquo;<br>Ila gave a happy little hop, which made Gus and her father laugh, and they progressed as a group to Leo&rsquo;s room.<br>Gus shoved the door open. Leo was asleep. Leo loved to sleep almost as much as he loved to read books.<br>Except for their looks, Gus and Leo were as different as twins could be. Gus didn&rsquo;t hate reading; she just didn&rsquo;t have time for it. She was happiest when she was moving. She liked to run, and was the only fifth grader on the Girls A soccer team. But what she really loved was swimming. Gus swam on the school&rsquo;s club team in the winter, and on the town team in the summer. She loved the smell of the water, the salt of the ocean, even the chlorine smell of the school pool. As soon as she got in the water, everything else faded. In the pool she was not the smart Brennan&rsquo;s sister, or the sister of the Brennan who never spoke. She was simply the fastest swimmer.<br>Leo swam too, but while Gus was winning her races, he was usually ruining a library book by the edge of the pool. Their mother always said that if he could only figure out how to read in his sleep, Leo would be perfectly happy for the rest of his life. As it was, he usually settled for reading himself to sleep, which he had clearly done the night before. He was lying on his side with his face mashed into the book that lay open on his pillow. His glasses were half on and half off, tilted at the crazy angle they had slipped to in the night.<br>&ldquo;Leo!&rdquo; Gus said.<br>&ldquo;Humph.&rdquo; Leo did not move.<br>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s making pancakes, Leo!&rdquo;<br>At this, Leo opened one eye, dark brown, almost black, like Gus&rsquo;s. Leo and Gus took after their mother, who was small and slender with glossy dark hair and coffee-colored eyes. Ila&rsquo;s curly red hair and oddly colored eyes were her own. Her eyes appeared to be brown, the same dark shade as Leo&rsquo;s and Gus&rsquo;s, but a closer look revealed a starburst of incandescent green at the center of each one. Looking into Ila&rsquo;s eyes was dizzying.<br>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mom?&rdquo; Leo asked, sitting up and sliding his glasses back onto his nose. His hair stood up so that he looked like a hedgehog in danger. His book thumped to the floor.<br>&ldquo;Under the weather,&rdquo; their father said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re stuck with me.&rdquo;<br>Leo grinned and pushed his hair away from his face, which resulted in it sticking even farther up in the air.<br>&ldquo;Pancakes,&rdquo; he said approvingly.<br><br>Their mother stayed in bed all day.<br>&ldquo;She must be really sick,&rdquo; Gus said to Leo. They were playing chess on an old wooden board on the living room floor. Ila was alternating between looking at her favorite book, one about a frog and a toad that were best friends, and playing with her stuffed bear, dressing and undressing it and leading it on soundless adventures across the rug.<br>Gus and Leo&rsquo;s sister was a little bit weird. Well, really, a lot weird. For one thing, she didn&rsquo;t talk. It wasn&rsquo;t that she was quiet or slow to respond, but that she didn&rsquo;t talk at all. Ila was five years old, but she had never spoken a word. She was also what their mother called sensitive. Although Ila couldn&rsquo;t--or wouldn&rsquo;t--speak, she definitely could scream. When she was a baby, it seemed like anything would make her scream: being wrapped too tightly in her blankets, or being woken suddenly, or the one--and only--time Gus had been allowed to feed her from her bottle.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not you,&rdquo; her mother had said as she plucked the writhing, shrieking baby from Gus&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;The milk was too cold--that&rsquo;s all, Gussy. Not you.&rdquo;<br>Gus was hurt anyway. She had been waiting with huge excitement for the new baby. She and Leo were five when Ila arrived. Leo had taken a good look at her and wandered away, but Gus loved her from the start. When Ila had first peered up at her with her strange, beautiful eyes, Gus could barely breathe. Her own sister.<br>But the baby, it turned out, was not really that much fun. For one thing, she cried all the time. Anything sudden--a light flicked on in a dark room, a siren going by, even the bang of a door closing--would make Ila panic. Her small face would turn bright red, her eyes would squinch shut, and then she would start screaming.<br>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just a little overwhelmed,&rdquo; their father had said. But it was more than that. It was as if Ila had keener senses than the rest of them and was being bombarded by the world at its regular, human-made level. For instance, Gus was pretty sure Ila could see in the dark. She never bothered to turn the lights on in their room, not even at night. Gus liked to believe that her little sister, having lost so much by not speaking, had gained in other areas.<br>&ldquo;She also has better hearing than any of us,&rdquo; she pointed out to her father. &ldquo;Remember when the Browns&rsquo; cat went missing and Ila was the one who found him in the closet in the spare room? Nobody else could hear him meowing.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just because she&rsquo;s so quiet herself,&rdquo; her father said, but Gus thought he looked pleased at the thought of his youngest having gifts instead of merely the deficit of silence.<br>As Ila got older, her tantrums got better. But Mrs. Destito, the nurse practitioner at the clinic, was concerned about the Brennans&rsquo; youngest child. Since it was difficult to bring Ila to her office, where the strange noises and bright lights could set her off, she had sent a young woman to their house to examine her. A behavior specialist, she called herself. She had a high-pitched voice that went up even higher when she spoke to Ila. It sounded like she was talking to a puppy.<br>&ldquo;Such an interesting name,&rdquo; the woman said in her puppy voice. &ldquo;What in the world does it mean, I wonder?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It means island,&rdquo; their mother said shortly.<br>&ldquo;&thinsp;&lsquo;Island,&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;How very, mmm, odd.&rdquo;<br>No one said anything. What was there to say to such a rude comment?<br>&ldquo;Now, Ila,&rdquo; the woman had crooned, &ldquo;Show me your nice bear?&rdquo; When she said bear, she stretched the word out so that it sounded like two long words, the second one a question.<br>They were in the living room, having tea and cookies. Ila, who was three at the time, was playing on the rug with the first of her many bears. She ignored the woman.<br>&ldquo;Ila,&rdquo; their father said, &ldquo;Say hello to the nice lady.&rdquo; His voice gave away what he really thought of the nice lady. Ila ignored him as well.<br>&ldquo;Hmmm,&rdquo; the woman said, making a note in the spiral notebook that she pulled out of a large canvas bag. The bag also held toys, which she offered, one by one, to Ila. She ignored them all in favor of her bear, who was now practicing headstands on the living room rug.<br>After a while, Leo drifted out, no doubt to go to his room to read or to continue training his turtles, one of whom he claimed could pick between a blue string and a red string almost 100 percent of the time. Gus had stayed, sitting quietly on one end of the couch, hoping not to be asked to leave. Gus loved listening in on adults&rsquo; conversations, even when they were boring. And she sensed that this conversation, while slightly boring at the moment, was very important.<br>The behavior specialist had been talking at great length about something called early intervention.<br>&ldquo;With the right training,&rdquo; she said, leaning forward as she spoke, &ldquo;Ila can even learn to interact with regularly abled children!&rdquo; She sounded delighted at her own prediction. &ldquo;We will need to do more testing, of course, to see where Ila falls--&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; their mother interrupted. <br>The woman looked startled.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; their mother said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been doing quite a bit of research, and Ila just doesn&rsquo;t fit the profile. She makes perfect eye contact, for example. And she plays with Gus and Leo, doesn&rsquo;t she, Peter?&rdquo;<br>Her voice rose just a bit as she said his name. Their father put an arm around her shoulders. Ila played quietly at their feet. Gus sat as still as possible.<br>&ldquo;She makes eye contact!&rdquo; their mother said again. She sounded like she might cry. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just--quiet. Quiet and a bit sensitive. We don&rsquo;t want her subjected to any more testing. We--&rdquo;<br>The woman leaned forward again, and Gus&rsquo;s mother stopped speaking. &ldquo;Ila,&rdquo; the woman said, and her voice was suddenly quite normal. &ldquo;Can you come over here, Ila?&rdquo;<br>The room went very still. Gus found herself holding her breath as she waited for her little sister to respond. Go on, Ila! she wanted to say, but she forced herself to keep still.<br>Ila looked up at the behavior specialist, her eyes shining in the light from the lamp behind the couch. She smiled and waved one chubby hand.<br>Their mother said--and now she really was crying--&ldquo;You see! Well done, Ila! Go on over, honey.&rdquo;<br>Ila obediently toddled over to the woman, who scooped her up. Gus braced herself, but Ila seemed content to sit on the woman&rsquo;s lap. She examined the string of pearls that the woman wore around her neck. Everyone in the room relaxed. Gus&rsquo;s mother wiped her eyes. But then the woman made the mistake of pulling a tiny penlight from her shirt pocket and shining it in Ila&rsquo;s eyes, making the starbursts at the center of them glow a dangerous, vivid green.<br>&ldquo;What unusual eyes! I&rsquo;m just going to track her pupils,&rdquo; the woman said brightly, shining the light back and forth. Ila&rsquo;s face grew pink, and then red.<br>&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; their father said. The corners of his mouth twitched.<br>Gus clamped her hands over her ears just as Ila shrieked and pulled away from the woman, who made the second mistake of taking hold of her wrists.<br>When it was all over--the spilled tea mopped up, the crushed cookies swept, the lamp put right, and the behavior specialist shown politely but firmly to her car--their father had called a family meeting.<br>&ldquo;Your sister is just fine,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d said sternly, looking from Gus to Leo and back to Gus. Ila was in bed, having exhausted herself with screaming. &ldquo;There will be no more talk of this-ism or that-ism,&rdquo; their father continued.<br>&ldquo;Ila is who she is,&rdquo; their mother added, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s final.&rdquo;<br>Gus and Leo looked at one another, bewildered. They had decided a long time ago that their weird little sister was just that--their weird little sister. Why talk about it more?<br>&ldquo;Duh, Dad,&rdquo; Leo said finally.<br>&ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; Gus said, &ldquo;I think Leo&rsquo;s weirder than Ila. I mean, he trains turtles.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very underrated,&rdquo; Leo said complacently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear from Ditmars&rsquo;s Reptiles of the World that they have much more complicated family structures than most people think.&rdquo;<br>Gus looked pointedly at their father.<br>&ldquo;Well, OK, then,&rdquo; he said, throwing up his hands. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some lunch.&rdquo;<br>As it turned out, Ila did have to have more testing, but none of the tests ever turned up anything actually wrong with her, other than her silence. In the end it was decided that she had something called selective mutism, which meant that she could understand language perfectly well and could, and probably would, speak someday. Her sensitivity to lights and noise got better as she got older. She went to kindergarten, and her teacher admitted that she seemed to be learning everything along with the other children. She&rsquo;ll talk when she is ready, their parents said, and so, for the time being anyway, that was that.<br>If they had lived in a bigger town, Ila might have been teased, or worse. But in their tiny town, where everybody knew everyone else, she was simply known as the Brennans&rsquo; quiet child, in much the same way that Gus was known as the fastest swimmer on the team and Leo as a bookworm.<br>Leo was also frustratingly good at chess. Luckily, he rarely paid attention long enough to beat Gus.<br>&ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; said Leo now, moving a horse. He was not looking at the board. Behind him, Ila laid her bear on the rug and tucked a blanket around it for bedtime.<br>&ldquo;Leo!&rdquo; Gus scolded him. &ldquo;That leaves your king open!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Leo said, moving the horse back. &ldquo;I was reading this cool book about wolves last night. I was just thinking about pack families. Did you know, Gus--&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; Gus said. &ldquo;Just go.&rdquo;<br>Leo slid a pawn forward, saying, as if Gus had not interrupted him, &ldquo;So then the alpha female--the mother wolf--pukes up her food for the cubs--&rdquo;<br>Gus sighed. &ldquo;Check,&rdquo; she said, and took his queen.<br><br>Their mother came down for dinner. Her face was pale and she had dark circles under her eyes, as if she had been sick for weeks rather than just one day.<br>&ldquo;Feeling better, Rosie?&rdquo; their father asked gently, and she murmured, &ldquo;Oh yes, thanks, darling,&rdquo; as she took her seat, folding into the chair.<br>All through dinner she was remote and tense. When the wind banged a shutter at the back of the house, she actually jumped from her chair with a slight scream. Their father was up and at her side immediately.<br>&ldquo;Rosemaris,&rdquo; he said, and then when she did not answer him but continued to look wildly about her, as if expecting intruders to burst into the kitchen, he said, &ldquo;Rosie! It&rsquo;s just the wind. It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; their mother said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just a little tired, I think.&rdquo;",

      excerpt:
        "Chapter One<br><br>Enders gave me the creeps. The doorman flashed a practiced smile as he let me into the body bank. He wasn&rsquo;t that old, maybe 110, but he still made me shudder. Like most Enders, he sported silver hair, some phony badge of honor of his age. Inside, the ultramodern space with its high ceilings dwarfed me. I walked through the lobby as if gliding through a dream, my feet barely touching the marble floor.<br><br>He directed me to the receptionist, who had white hair and matte red lipstick that transferred to her front teeth when she smiled. They had to be nice to me there, in the body bank. But if they saw me on the street, I&rsquo;d be invisible. Forget that I had been top of my class--back when there was school. I was sixteen. A baby to them.<br><br>The receptionist&rsquo;s heels clicked and echoed in this stark space as she took me to a small waiting room, empty except for silver brocade chairs in the corners. They looked like antiques, but the chemical scent in the air belonged to new paint and synthetics. The so-called nature sounds of forest birds were just as fake. I glanced at my frayed sweats and scuffed shoes. I had brushed them as best I could, but the stains would not go away. And because I had tramped all the way to Beverly Hills in the morning drizzle, I was also wet as a lost cat.<br><br>My feet hurt. I wanted to collapse into a chair, but I didn&rsquo;t dare leave a damp butt-mark on the brocade. A tall Ender popped into the room, interrupting my little etiquette dilemma.<br><br>&ldquo;Callie Woodland?&rdquo; He looked at his watch. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re late.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Sorry. The rain&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. You&rsquo;re here.&rdquo; He extended his hand.<br><br>His silver hair seemed whiter in contrast to his artificial tan. As his smile broadened, his eyes widened, making me more nervous than usual with an Ender. They didn&rsquo;t deserve to be called seniors, as they preferred, these greedy old fogies at the end of their lives. I forced myself to shake his wrinkled hand.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mr. Tinnenbaum. Welcome to Prime Destinations.&rdquo; He wrapped his other palm over mine.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just here to see&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&rdquo; I looked around at the walls like I&rsquo;d come to inspect the interior design.<br><br>&ldquo;How it all works? Of course. No charge for that.&rdquo; He grinned and finally released my hand. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you follow me?&rdquo;<br><br>He extended his arm as if I couldn&rsquo;t find my way out of the room. His teeth were so bright, I flinched a little when he smiled. We walked down a short hallway to his office.<br><br>&ldquo;Go right in, Callie. Have a seat by the desk.&rdquo; He closed the door.<br><br>I bit my tongue to keep from gasping at the total extravagance inside. A massive copper fountain flowed with endless water alongside one wall. The way they were letting this clear, clean water fall and splash, you&rsquo;d think the stuff was free.<br><br>A glass desk embedded with LED lights dominated the center of the room, with an airscreen display hovering a foot above it. It showed a picture of a girl my age, with long red hair, wearing gym shorts. Although she was smiling, the photo was straight-on, like some full-length mug shot. Her expression was sweet. Hopeful.<br><br>I sat in a modern metal chair as Mr. Tinnenbaum stood behind the desk, pointing at the air display. &ldquo;One of our newest members. Like you, she heard about us through a friend. The women who rented her body were quite pleased.&rdquo; He touched the corner of the screen, changing the picture to a teen in a racing swimsuit, with major abs. &ldquo;This fellow, Adam, referred her. He can snowboard, ski, climb. He&rsquo;s a popular rental for outdoorsy men who haven&rsquo;t been able to enjoy these sports for decades.&rdquo;<br><br>Hearing his words made it all too real. Creepy old Enders with arthritic limbs taking over this teen&rsquo;s body for a week, living inside his skin. It made my stomach flip. I wanted to bolt, but one thought kept me there.<br><br>Tyler.<br><br>I gripped the seat of my chair with both hands. My stomach growled. Tinnenbaum extended a pewter dish of Supertruffles in paper cups. My parents had had the same dish, once.<br><br>&ldquo;Would you like one?&rdquo; he asked.<br><br>I took one of the oversized chocolates in silence. Then I remembered my rusty manners. &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Take more.&rdquo; He waved the dish to entice me.<br><br>I took a second and a third, since the dish still hovered near my hand. I wrapped them in their paper cups and slipped them into my sweatshirt pocket. He looked disappointed not to see me eat them, like I was to be his entertainment for the day. Behind my chair, the fountain bubbled and splashed, teasing me. If he didn&rsquo;t offer me something to drink soon, he just might get to see me with my head under the fountain, slurping like a dog.<br><br>&ldquo;Could I have a glass of water? Please?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; He snapped his fingers and then raised his voice as if speaking to some hidden device. &ldquo;Glass of water for the young lady.&rdquo;<br><br>A moment later, an Ender with the figure of a model came in balancing a glass of water on a tray. It was wrapped in a cloth napkin. I took the glass and saw small cubes glistening like diamonds. Ice. She set the tray beside me and left.<br><br>I tilted my head back and downed the sweet water all at once, the cool liquid running down my throat. My eyes closed as I savored the cleanest water I&rsquo;d had since the war ended. When I finished, I let one of the ice cubes fall into my mouth. I bit into it with a crunch. When I opened my eyes, I saw Tinnenbaum staring at me.<br><br>&ldquo;Would you like more?&rdquo; he asked.<br><br>I would have, but his eyes told me he didn&rsquo;t mean it. I shook my head and finished the cube. My fingernails looked even dirtier against the glass as I set it back on the tray. Seeing the ice melting in the glass reminded me of the last time I had had ice water. It seemed like forever, but it was only a year ago, the last day in our house before the marshals came.<br><br>&ldquo;Would you like to know how it all works?&rdquo; Tinnenbaum asked. &ldquo;Here at Prime Destinations?&rdquo;<br><br>I stopped myself from rolling my eyes. Enders. Why else would I be there? I gave him a half smile and nodded.<br><br>He tapped a corner of the airscreen to clear it, and then a second time to bring up holo-mations. The first one showed a senior reclining on a lounge chair, the back of her head being fitted with a small cap. Colored wires protruding from the cap led to a computer.<br><br>&ldquo;The renter is connected to a BCI--Body Computer Interface--in a room staffed with experienced nurses,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then she&rsquo;s put into a twilight sleep.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Like at the dentist?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Yes. All her vital signs are monitored throughout the entire journey.&rdquo; On the other side of the screen, a teen girl reclined in a long padded chair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be put under, with a kind of anesthesia. Completely painless and harmless. You wake up a week later, a little groggy but a whole lot richer.&rdquo; He flashed those teeth again.<br><br>I forced myself not to wince. &ldquo;What happens during the week?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;She gets to be you.&rdquo; He spread his palms and rotated them. &ldquo;Do you know about computer assists that help amputees move fake hands? They just think about it and it moves? It&rsquo;s very much like that.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;So she visualizes that she&rsquo;s me and if she wants something, she just thinks it and my hand grabs it?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Just like she was in your body. She uses her mind to walk your body out of here, and gets to be young again.&rdquo; He cradled one elbow in his other hand. &ldquo;For a little while.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;But how&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;?&rdquo;<br><br>He nodded to the other side of the screen. &ldquo;Over here, in another room, the donor--that would be you--is connected to the computer via a wireless BCI.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Wireless?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;We insert a tiny neurochip into the back of your head. You won&rsquo;t feel a thing. Totally painless. Allows us to connect you to the computer at all times. We then connect your brain waves to the computer, and the computer connects the two of you.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Connects.&rdquo; My brow furrowed as I tried to imagine two minds connected that way. BCI. Neurochip. Inserted. This was getting creepier by the minute. That urge to run was coming back hard. But at the same time, I wanted to know more.<br><br>&ldquo;I know, it&rsquo;s all so new.&rdquo; He gave me a condescending smirk. &ldquo;We make sure you&rsquo;re completely asleep. The renter&rsquo;s mind takes over your body. She answers a series of questions posed by the team to be sure everything is working the way it should. Then she&rsquo;s free to go enjoy her rented body.&rdquo;<br><br>The diagram showed graphics of the rented body playing golf, playing tennis, diving.<br><br>&ldquo;The body retains its muscle memory, so whatever sports you&rsquo;ve played, she&rsquo;ll be able to play. When the time is over, the renter walks the body back here. The connection is shut down in the proper sequence. The renter is taken off the twilight-sleep drugs. She is checked over and then goes on her merry way. You, the donor, are restored to your full brain functions via the computer. You awake in your body as if you&rsquo;d slept for several days.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What if something happens to me while she&rsquo;s in my body? Snowboarding, skydiving? What if I get hurt?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Nothing like that has ever happened here. Our renters sign a contract that makes them financially liable. Believe me, everyone wants that deposit back.&rdquo;<br><br>He made me sound like a rental car. A chill went through me like someone had run an ice cube up my spine. That reminded me of Tyler, the only thing keeping me in that chair.<br><br>&ldquo;What about the chip?&rdquo; I asked.<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s removed after your third rental.&rdquo; He handed me a sheet of paper. &ldquo;Here. This might put you at ease.&rdquo;<br><br><br><br>Rules for Renters at Prime Destinations<br><br>1. You may not alter the appearance of your rental body in any way, including but not limited to piercings, tattoos, hair cutting or dyeing, cosmetic contact lenses, and any surgical procedures, including augmentation.<br><br>2. No changes to the teeth are allowed, including fillings, removal, and imbedded jewelry.<br><br>3. You must remain inside a fifty-mile perimeter around Prime Destinations. Maps are available.<br><br>4. Any attempt to tamper with the chip will result in immediate cancellation without refund, and fines will be levied.<br><br>5. If you have a problem with your rental body, return to Prime Destinations as soon as possible. Please treat your rental with care, remembering at all times that it is an actual young person.<br><br>Be advised that each neurochip blocks renters from engaging in illegal activities.<br><br><br><br>The rules didn&rsquo;t make me feel any better. They brought up more problems I hadn&rsquo;t even considered.<br><br>&ldquo;What about&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;other things?&rdquo; I asked.<br><br>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; I wished he wasn&rsquo;t going to make me say it. But he was. &ldquo;Sex?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in the rules,&rdquo; I said.<br><br>I sure didn&rsquo;t want my first time to happen when I wasn&rsquo;t there.<br><br>He shook his head. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s made quite clear to the renters. It is forbidden.&rdquo;<br><br>Yeah, right. At least pregnancy would be impossible. Everyone knew that was a side effect, hopefully temporary, of the vaccination.<br><br>My stomach tightened. I shook the hair back from my eyes and stood.<br><br>&ldquo;Thanks for your time, Mr. Tinnenbaum. And the demonstration.&rdquo;<br><br>His lip twitched. He tried to cover it with a half smile. &ldquo;If you sign today, there&rsquo;s a bonus.&rdquo; He pulled a form out of his drawer and scribbled on it, then slid it across the desk. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for three rentals.&rdquo; He capped his pen.<br><br>I picked up the contract. That money could buy us a house and food for a year. I sat back down and took a deep breath.<br><br>He held out the pen. I grabbed it.<br><br>&ldquo;Three rentals?&rdquo; I asked.<br><br>&ldquo;Yes. And you&rsquo;ll be paid upon completion.&rdquo;<br><br>The paper waved. I realized my hand was shaking.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very generous offer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s with the bonus if you sign today.&rdquo;<br><br>I needed that money. Tyler needed it.<br><br>As I gripped the pen, the bubbling of the fountain got louder in my head. I was staring at the paper but saw flashes of the matte red lipstick, the eyes of the doorman, Mr. Tinnenbaum&rsquo;s unreal teeth. I pressed the pen to the paper, but before I made a mark, I looked up at him. Maybe I wanted one last reassurance. He nodded and smiled. His suit was perfect, except for a piece of white lint on his lapel. It was shaped like a question mark.<br><br>He was so eager. Before I knew it, I put the pen down.<br><br>His eyes narrowed. &ldquo;Something wrong?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just something my mother always said.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;She said always sleep on an important decision. I have to think about it.&rdquo;<br><br>His eyes went cold. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise this offer will be good later.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to take my chances.&rdquo; I folded the contract into my pocket and rose from the chair. I forced a little smile.<br><br>&ldquo;Can you afford to do that?&rdquo; He stepped in front of me.<br><br>&ldquo;Probably not. But I have to think about it.&rdquo; I moved around him and walked to the door.<br><br>&ldquo;Call if you have questions,&rdquo; he said a little too loudly.<br><br>I rushed past the receptionist, who seemed upset to see me leaving so soon. She followed me with her eyes as she punched what I imagined was a panic button. I kept going. The doorman stared at me through the glass door before opening it.<br><br>&ldquo;Leaving already?&rdquo; His hollow expression was ghoulish.<br><br>I bolted past him.",

      excerpt:
        'Chapter One<br>My hand went to the back of my head and I swore I could feel the chip underneath my skin. But I couldn\'t, of course; it was buried deeply under the metal blocking plate. It was just the surrounding scar tissue I felt, hard and unforgiving.<br>I tried not to touch it. But it had become an obsession to finger it like a splinter in a palm, or a hangnail on a thumb. It haunted me all the time, even here, making sandwiches in the kitchen. Helena\'s kitchen.<br>Even though she was dead and had left the mansion to me, I couldn\'t help but be reminded daily that it had been hers. Every choice, from the sea-green tiles to the elaborate island in the center of this gourmet kitchen, was hers. Even her housekeeper, Eugenia, remained.<br>Yes, it had been Helena\'s crazy plan to stop the Old Man by using my body to assassinate Senator Harrison. But it was my fault that I had volunteered to be a body donor in the first place. I had been desperate to save my little brother, Tyler, then. Now I couldn\'t take it back, any more than I could get rid of this horrible chip stuck in my head. I hated the thing. It was like a phone the Old Man could call anytime, a phone I had to answer and could never disconnect. It was the Old Man\'s direct line to me, Callie Woodland.<br>The last time I had heard from him was two days ago, while I was watching his precious Prime Destinations being demolished. He had sounded like my dead father, even used his code words: When hawks cry, time to fly. I\'d been thinking about that ever since. But as I stood at the kitchen counter spreading the last of the peanut butter on whole wheat, I decided that it had been the Old Man playing tricks on me. Cruel, but no surprise coming from that monster.<br>"Finished?" Eugenia asked.<br>Her crackly Ender voice cut through me. I hadn\'t heard her come in. How long had she been watching? I turned to meet the scowl on her wrinkled face. If this was my fairy-tale life, living in this castle, she would be the ugly stepmother.<br>"That\'s enough. You\'re emptying my entire pantry," she said.<br>That wasn\'t true. I\'d made several dozen sandwiches, but our pantry could feed us for a month. I placed the last one in the insta-wrap machine, and the thin veg-wrap encased the bread instantly with a high-pitched zip.<br>"Done." I tossed the sandwiches into a duffel bag.<br>Eugenia didn\'t even wait for me to leave before she began wiping the counter. I\'d obviously ruined her day.<br>"We can\'t feed the whole world," she said, scrubbing invisible stains.<br>"Course not." I closed the duffel bag and slung it over my shoulder. "Just a few hungry Starters."<br><br>As I put the bag in the trunk of the blue sports car, I couldn\'t get Eugenia\'s disapproving glare out of my mind. You\'d think maybe she\'d be nicer, knowing my mother and father were dead. But somehow she resented me for Helena\'s death. It wasn\'t my fault. In fact, Helena had almost gotten me killed. I slammed the trunk. Eugenia only stayed because she adored Tyler. That was okay; I didn\'t have to answer to her. She wasn\'t my guardian.<br>My hand went to the back of my head, and I absentmindedly scratched at my chip wound before I caught myself and stopped. When I looked at my fingers, my nails were dirty with blood. I winced.<br>I pulled a tissue out of my purse and wiped them as best I could. Then I walked out the door of the garage that led to the garden. Mossy stones, wet from the morning dew, led to the rose-covered cottage guesthouse. The place was quiet, no movement behind the windows. I knocked on the rough-hewn door, to see if he was back, but no answer.<br>The handle turned with a squeak. I poked my head inside.<br>"Michael?"<br>I hadn\'t been inside his cottage since we\'d all moved into the mansion. The place had taken on Michael\'s scent, a mix of artist\'s paints and freshly cut wood. Even when we had been squatters, he had always managed to smell good.<br>But what really marked the place as his was his amazing drawings, which covered the walls. The first one showed thin Starters with hungry, haunted eyes. They wore ragged layers of clothing, water bottles draped across their bodies, hand-lites banded around their wrists.<br>In the next image, three Starters fought over an apple. One lay on the ground, hurt. My life just a few months ago. But the next drawing was even tougher to look at.<br>My friend Sara. A Starter I had hoped to rescue. I\'d told Michael about her and our time together at Institution 37, the nightmarish place where marshals had locked me up with other unclaimed Starters. The sketch showed Sara after she had diverted the guards\' attention away from me and ended up ZipTasered, clinging to barbed wire as she was dying. Michael had never met her, but like most street Starters, he was familiar with desperation and bravery. He portrayed the willing sacrifice in her eyes.<br>The drawing blurred in my vision. I\'d never find a friend that loyal if I lived a million years. She\'d given me everything and I\'d let her down.<br>That was my fault.<br>Someone entered the cottage. I turned to see Tyler coming in.<br>"Monkey-Face!" he shouted.<br>I quickly wiped my eyes. He ran up and wrapped his arms around my legs. Michael was behind him, standing in the doorway, smiling. Then he closed the door and put down his travel bag.<br>"You\'re back." I looked at Michael.<br>He shook his shaggy blond hair out of his face and looked surprised at the concern in my voice.<br>Tyler pulled away. "Michael brought me this."<br>He waved a small toy truck and ran it over the top of the couch.<br>"Where\'ve you been?" I asked. Michael had been out of my sight since Prime was demolished.<br>He shrugged. "Just needed some space."<br>I knew that he wouldn\'t say anything with Tyler there. I knew he had seen me holding hands with Blake, Senator Harrison\'s grandson. Two puppets of the Old Man.<br>"Look, what you saw, that didn\'t mean anything," I said in a lowered voice. "And you, you and Florina--"<br>"That\'s over."<br>We stared at each other. Tyler was still playing, making car sounds, but of course he could hear us. I tried to think of what to say to explain my feelings, but I honestly didn\'t know what my feelings were. The Old Man, Blake, Michael--it was all so jumbled.<br>My phone beeped a reminder: three unread Zings.<br>"Someone dying to reach you?" Michael asked.<br>The Zings were all from Blake. He\'d been trying to contact me since the day I saw him at Prime\'s destruction.<br>"It\'s him, right?" Michael said.<br>I shoved the phone into my pocket, cocked my head, and gave him a look that said "don\'t push me."<br>Tyler glanced anxiously from Michael to me.<br>"We\'re going to the mall," Tyler said. "To get me shoes."<br>"Without asking me first?" I clung to my shoulder bag and stared at Michael.<br>"He begged me," Michael said. "And his favorites are too small now."<br>"He\'s growing so fast, better buy two sizes."<br>We were all glad to see Tyler healthy after a year squatting in cold buildings. "Come with us," Tyler said.<br>"I\'d love to, but I\'m off."<br>"Where to?" Michael asked.<br>"Our old neighborhood. To feed the Starters."<br>"Want help?" Michael asked.<br>"Why? You think I can\'t do this alone?" I said.<br>As soon as I snapped, I wished I could suck the words back in. Michael looked so hurt. Tyler\'s mouth fell open in an "uh-oh" moment.<br>"I\'m sorry," I said to Michael. "Thanks for offering. Really. But I think I can handle it. You guys should go to the mall."<br>"You could meet us for lunch," Tyler said. "After we get my shoes."<br>He took Michael\'s hand and gave me his best "please please" face. We were the closest thing he had to parents, and he was doing everything he could to pull us together. What I really wanted was to make our parents magically reappear; to have our family back again. But I would have to settle for just fulfilling my brother\'s small request.<br><br>I balanced the duffel bag on my shoulder as I pushed open the side door of the abandoned office building that had been home for Michael and Tyler--and Florina--when I was being rented out. I stepped into the lobby and saw the reception desk, vacant as usual. I would never have admitted it to Michael, but my heart was beating harder. Faster. I held my breath to listen for any signs of danger. I was familiar with the place, but things change. Who knew which Starters lived here now?<br>I walked over to the reception desk to make sure no one was hiding, ready to attack. It was clear. I set my duffel bag on the counter, unzipped it, and pulled out a towel. As I was wiping the counter, I heard footsteps behind me. Before I realized what was happening, someone darted by and grabbed the whole bag.<br>"Hey!" I shouted.<br>A chubby little Starter ran to the exit, clutching my bag. Several sandwiches spilled out and dropped to the floor.<br>"That\'s supposed to be for everyone, you little jerk!" I yelled.<br>He burst through the door. I\'d never catch up.<br>I ran around from behind the desk and bent down to pick up the food that had fallen. I had my hand on a wrapped sandwich when someone stepped on me.<br>"Back off." It was a Starter girl, maybe a year older than I was.<br>She held a plank of wood like a bat, ready to strike. The rusty nails at the end of the plank convinced me not to fight. I nodded. She eased her foot off my hand and I pulled it away.<br>"Take it," I said, nodding to the smashed sandwich.<br>She grabbed it and the other two on the floor. She bit right through the wrapper and started eating, making feral sounds. Thin, with short, dirty hair, she had probably once been just a middle-class girl. Like me.<br>I\'d been that hungry before, but no one had ever come to my building to feed me. And now I knew why.<br>She swallowed. "You." She stepped closer and touched my hair. "So clean." Then she examined my face. "Perfect. You\'re a Metal, aren\'t you?"<br>"A what?"<br>"You know, Metal. One of those body bank people. You\'ve got that chip in your head." She took another bite of the sandwich, peeling back the wrapper this time. "How does it feel?" She circled me to stare at the back of my head.<br>I wore the plainest clothes I had been able to find in Helena\'s granddaughter\'s closet. But I couldn\'t disguise my now-flawless skin, shiny hair, and perfect features. It was too obvious to the world that I had become a kind of chip slave.<br>"Like someone owns me."<br><br>The glittery mall was completely different from the harsh, lawless squatter life. Ender guards stood watch outside the shops, examining each passing Starter with steely stares. One guard spied some scruffy boys advertising their unclaimed status with dirty faces and stained jeans. He signaled mall security, and they roughly escorted the boys to the exit.<br>This had been a high-end mall even before the Spore Wars widened the gap between the rich and poor. Though not all Enders were rich and not all Starters were poor, it often seemed that way. But here, I passed plenty of hot Starters, shimmering in their illusion tops and jeans, which changed color and texture as they moved. They were like exotic birds, even the guys, wearing airscreen glasses, layers of scarves, hats with slim solar panels to charge batteries. Those who had temperature-control chips in their glistening metallic jackets kept them on. Others used insta-fold to compress their outerwear so it could be tucked into a wallet. People said they dressed this way to distinguish themselves from the street Starters. I had a closetful of clothes just like theirs, inherited from Helena\'s granddaughter. But that wasn\'t my style.<br>These were the claimed Starters living in mansions like mine. I couldn\'t always tell them apart from people like me who had received makeovers from the body bank. "Metals," that girl had said. These mall Starters were beautiful because they could afford to be. They had the best Ender dermatologists, dentists, and hairstylists and all the creams and beauty supplies their grandparents could buy. The Spore Wars had barely put a dent in their spending habits.<br>I stopped myself. There I was, judging them, but they\'d lost their parents too. Maybe their grandparents weren\'t nice to them, but cold and resentful, having to see faces every day that reminded them of their lost sons and daughters.<br>The Spore Wars had changed us all.<br>I scratched the back of my head and looked around, hoping to see a shoe store. I was supposed to meet Michael and Tyler at the food court, but since my mission to feed the homeless had been a failure, I was early. I swallowed hard, thinking about it. Michael was right--I shouldn\'t have gone alone. I should have remembered my street smarts: Never take your hand off your bag. Never stand with your back to an entrance. Always be ready to fight. All that work and I\'d only fed two Starters, who had run off without even thanking me.<br>I directed my attention to the airscreen display directory in the middle of the mall.<br>"Shoes," I said to the invisible microphone.<br>The display pulled the shoe store out of the map and projected a holo into the air. It was the only athletic shoe store in the mall. Knowing Tyler, he was trying on every pair there. I needed to go rescue Michael.<br>I headed toward the store, passing an Ender grandmother leaning on the arm of a pretty Starter, probably her granddaughter.<br>She\'s easy on the eyes.<br>I stopped.<br>It was that artificial, electronic voice in my head, and it set my teeth on edge.<br>The Old Man.<br>Hello, Callie. Did you miss me?<br>"No. Not a bit." I struggled to make my voice sound even. "Out of sight, out of mind."<br>Clever.<br>I then remembered he could see through my eyes. I put my hands behind my back so he couldn\'t see that they were shaking.<br>I don\'t buy that at all. I\'m sure you thought about me every day. Every hour. Every minute.<br>"It\'s all about you, is it?" I really wanted to scream at him, but the guards would think I was crazy.',

Well, there was this time, for example . . .<br><br>Chapter #1<br>HOMEWORK CHEESE and THE BOOGER BUBBLE FREAKOUT<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Starring<br>THE NOT-SO-SAFE WATERMELON BIKE HELMET!<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Yesterday, Gus came over to my house and wanted to go bike riding. I couldn't find my bike helmet. So instead of wasting time looking for it, I decided to make a helmet.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; I brought a watermelon from the kitchen out to the front steps. I cut it in half with a plastic knife because I'm not allowed to use real knives and that took forever. Then I scooped out all of the insides. I put the watermelon on my head. It looked really cool. I had an awesome bike helmet, even though it was all drippy and stuff. Then Gus wanted a watermelon helmet, too. So we made his from the other half of the watermelon.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We didn't know if the helmets were safe for bike riding, so we tested them. We dropped things on them, like a book, splop! And a shoe, clomp! And a wrench, blonk! And then a really big book, kasplop! Then we did one more test. We ran into a wall as hard as we could.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Wham! <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>Splop!</i> The helmets cracked, and the juices and gunk ran all over our faces. We couldn't go bike riding.<br>But all of that testing had made us hungry. We went back to the steps and scraped all of the watermelon insides into a bowl. But there were ants in it now, and a leaf and a stick. I don't eat ants. (It's not fair to them.) We let the ants have the watermelon, and we picked out the seeds.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We decided to have a watermelon seed-spitting contest.",

        "What makes Icky Ricky so icky? Well, there was this time, for example . . .<br><br>Chapter #1<br>THE EGYPTIAN PIZZA FUNERAL<br>Part #1<br>Featuring<br>THE ONE-EYED SQUIRREL,<br>THE EXPLODING JUICE BOX,<br>and THE FEARSOME MAN-DOG!<br><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We grabbed the pizza and ran out of the house. It was a bit dark and cloudy, but it wasn't raining. We started running down the street, but Gus said he didn't like passing the house with the freaky man-dog. It's a dog that lost some fur around his eyes, so around his eyes it's kind of skin-colored, and it looks like a man wearing a dog mask. So we turned around and went the other way. But Stew said he doesn't like going that way because of the one-eyed squirrel. There really is a one eyed squirrel that lives in a tree or something, and it's the meanest squirrel ever. Once I saw it snatch a cookie right out of a kid's hand!<br>&#160;&#160; We ended up taking a small path that leads between the houses. We followed the little stream back there, and finally came out on the next block. We had about six blocks to go when we saw some lightning, and then boom! There was this huge thunder explosion! Then it started raining like crazy. I held the pizza box over my head so I could stay dry. We ran to find someplace to get out of the rain.<br>&#160;&#160; Then Gus screamed \"One-eyed squirrel!\" and he pointed to something in the trees.<br>&#160;&#160; And I was like, \"He wants the pizza!\"<br>&#160;&#160; Stew said, \"Run!\"",

Frankweiler,</i> and <i>The Dollpeople</i>!</b><br> &#160;<br> Chicago sixth graders Ruthie and Jack think they&rsquo;ve learned everything about the magic of the Art Institute&rsquo;s Thorne Rooms. But the magic starts to act strangely when Ruthie and Jack discover two rings that are out of place&mdash;and out of time&mdash;and a portal that shouldn&rsquo;t be open but somehow is. Ruthie and Jack follow the clues to seventeenth-century England and the Brownlow house, where they meet the Brownlow&rsquo;s governess, Rebecca. But Rebecca has a few secrets of her own&mdash;and she might even be in the wrong century! Can Ruthie and Jack discover the truth about Rebecca&rsquo;s mysterious past, or will they end up stuck in the wrong century themselves? Their quest for answers takes them from 1930s New York City and San Francisco to turn-of-the-century China. The only one who can truly answer their questions may be the woman who started it all: the room&rsquo;s creator, Narcissa Thorne. But to talk to Mrs. Thorne, they&rsquo;ll have to go back in time and find her!<br> &#160;<br> Unlock the magic . . . in the exciting conclusion to the Sixty-Eight Rooms Adventures!",

      excerpt:
        'Principal Sylvia Patterson pulled her office door shut, checked the lock, then hitched a stack of folders slightly higher in her left arm as she made her way down the empty halls of Mission High.<br><br> The school was silent except for the sound of her own breathing and the click of her heels on the polished gray linoleum. She passed darkened classrooms behind closed doors: the desks, tables, and chairs within were just vague, silhouetted forms beyond smudged glass panes. In each window she walked by, her reflection appeared distorted.<br><br> Even after nearly two decades in these halls, she always felt scared when the school was empty.<br><br> As she rounded a corner, Sylvia stopped. A trill of alarm passed through her: a figure stood just inside the double doors at the exit, partially hidden by shadows.<br><br> No one was allowed on school grounds after hours.<br><br> Sylvia dipped her right hand into her purse, closing her fingers around the can of Mace she always kept close by. "School\'s closed now," she chirped, hoping the intruder wouldn\'t hear the tremor in her voice.<br><br> "Sorry." The girl turned, her face now illuminated by the weak light flowing in from the parking lot outside.<br><br> Sylvia exhaled. "Oh, Corinthe. You startled me." She withdrew her hand from her purse. Silly to be so jumpy. It was only the new transfer student.<br><br> Corinthe stared at her silently. She had a careless, disheveled look, despite the fact that Sylvia had been careful to emphasize the importance of one\'s appearance when they\'d met for the first time yesterday to fill out her transfer paperwork. Corinthe might have been a very pretty girl, with her classic, well-spaced features and her pale gray eyes. Even her clothing was neat and well put-together--at least she cared about that part of her looks. It was the hair--the wild, tangled mess of blond that hung down her back--that told a different story.<br><br> Sylvia had been a principal for ten years and had a good eye for possibility. She sensed, after knowing Corinthe barely two days, that the girl could be a real standout if she applied herself. Unfortunately, experience had taught her that the kids in her school rarely lived up to their potential. Corinthe would probably end up just another lost child who fell through the cracks. During Sylvia\'s "Welcome to Mission High, Keep Your Nose Clean" speech, Corinthe had simply gazed at her, almost without breathing, her gray eyes completely flat, detached.<br><br> When children had no choices left, they all looked the same.<br><br> Corinthe shifted slightly in the doorway. "My foster mom was supposed to pick me up, but she never showed. Do you think . . . ?" Her voice trailed off and she raised her eyes expectantly.<br><br> Those eyes.<br><br> Sylvia shuffled her stack of folders from her left arm to her right so she could check her watch. It would take exactly twenty-six minutes to get home and change before Steve rang her doorbell. She couldn\'t be late for dinner, not after she\'d practically begged him for another chance.<br><br> "Where do you live?"<br><br> Corinthe tilted her head slightly, like a curious bird. "It won\'t be a long drive." Corinthe spoke in a measured tone, almost like an actor reciting lines. It was a slightly strange response, Sylvia thought, but dismissed it--Corinthe was likely desperate.<br><br> "Come on, then," Sylvia said. If they didn\'t hit traffic, she would be okay.<br><br> They left through the main doors and Sylvia walked quickly down the sidewalk. She was tired. Too tired to make small talk. Already her mind was on Steve--what she would wear, what she would say, whether she had remembered to get her favorite blouse back from the dry cleaner\'s.<br><br> She turned left at the end of the block and continued toward the staff lot, Corinthe\'s footsteps echoing lightly behind her.<br><br> Should she wear the green blouse? Or the blue one? The green one highlighted her eyes nicely . . . but the blue one was more low-cut. . . .&#160;<br><br> "Here we are," Sylvia said cheerfully. After ten years as a teacher and ten as an administrator, she knew how to keep up appearances, even when her thoughts were a thousand miles away. She stopped next to a small black sedan parked under a flickering streetlamp. She pulled out her keys and pressed the unlock button. A quick mechanical chirp echoed in the thick spring air. She threw her things into the back and slid into the driver\'s seat, slightly startled by how quickly Corinthe appeared beside her.<br><br> The car growled to life and Sylvia maneuvered it onto the street. "So. Which way?" she asked.<br><br> Corinthe pointed. Sylvia eyed the girl, then turned, zigzagging the car right onto Church, left onto Dubcoe, right onto Castro Street, each time in response to a silent gesture from Corinthe. The pendant hanging from her rearview mirror swayed back and forth with each turn. Corinthe, Sylvia noticed, kept looking at it with a slightly troubled expression.<br><br> "It\'s St. Jude," Sylvia explained. "The patron saint of lost causes. Kind of a sad saint, when you think about it." She half laughed. "Still, everyone could use a miracle, don\'t you think?"<br><br> "Sure, I guess," Corinthe said neutrally, the first words she had spoken since she\'d gotten into the car. After another minute, Corinthe raised her hand as Castro merged with Divisadero. "Keep straight here, all the way toward the water."<br><br> "You live near the Marina?" Sylvia wasn\'t surprised. "How do you like it?"<br><br> "It\'s okay for now." Her voice cracked just a little as the car smoothly rounded the slight curve.<br><br> Some emotion seemed to pass over Corinthe\'s face: Anxiety? Guilt? The expression was gone too quickly for Sylvia to decipher.<br><br> Suddenly, Sylvia wanted to reach out to Corinthe, to reassure her that things could be different if she only believed--if she tried. Sylvia knew that behind every student there was a story. That was why she kept doing this job day after day. There were moments--flashes, briefly held, like the light of a firefly--when she understood that this was the job she was meant for. If she could convince just one girl that her life was worth living, that she wasn\'t a lost cause . . . that there was someone who hadn\'t forgotten, who really saw her. . . .&#160;<br><br> "So, Corinthe," she began. "Where did you--?"<br><br> Corinthe braced her hand on the dashboard and closed her eyes. She\'d already seen it happen, knew what the outcome would be, but sitting there, waiting for the car to swerve, a tiny shiver of fear had gone up her spine.<br><br> There will be no miracles today.<br><br> The car dipped into a rut and the steering wheel jerked from Sylvia\'s hands, spinning them into oncoming traffic. Horns blared, tires screeched, and for a split second everything froze.<br><br> Sylvia never even had a chance to finish her question.',

        '<b>Perfect for fans of Jennifer Armentrout, Julie Kagawa, Rachel Vincent, and Sarah J. Maas, and for girls who love all things pretty, romantic and inspirational.<br></b><br>One moment. One foolish desire. One mistake. And Corinthe lost everything.<br><br>She fell from her tranquil life in Pyralis Terra and found herself exiled to the human world. Her punishment? To make sure people\'s fates unfold according to plan. Now, years later, Corinthe has one last assignment: kill Lucas Kaller. His death will be her ticket home.<br><br>But for the first time, Corinthe feels a tingle of doubt. It begins as a lump in her throat, then grows toward her heart, and suddenly she feels like she is falling all over again--this time for a boy she knows she can never have. Because it is written: one of them must live, and one of them must die. In a universe where every moment, every second, every fate has already been decided, where does love fit in?<br><br>"Different and imaginative."--<i>Kirkus Reviews<br></i>',

      excerpt:
        "1<br>&ldquo;Close your eyes. Tell me what you see.&rdquo;<br>Luc scowled and crossed his arms. &ldquo;How can we see anything with our eyes closed?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Just try.&rdquo;<br>Jasmine slipped her hand into her mother&rsquo;s and squeezed her eyes shut dutifully. It wasn&rsquo;t often that Mom took them out of the house anymore, and the trip to the Botanical Garden had been so spur-of-the-moment, so unexpected, that Mom had even forgotten to put Jasmine&rsquo;s shoes on. Jasmine was halfway to the car in socks before Luc had run after her, holding a pair of sneakers.<br>&ldquo;Good girl.&rdquo; A soft hand rested on top of Jasmine&rsquo;s head, and fingers stroked her long dark hair. &ldquo;Now take a deep breath. What do you see?&rdquo;<br>Jasmine inhaled a breath as big as her lungs would allow. A color came to her. Yellow. &ldquo;Lemon?&rdquo; she asked hesitantly.<br>&ldquo;Yes. And what else?&rdquo;<br>Luc snorted but Jasmine ignored him. He was going to ruin it. It felt so good to have Mom close, to feel her delicate fingers running through her hair again. She wanted to make her happy more than anything in the world.<br>&ldquo;Strawberry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I see a strawberry.&rdquo;<br>Mom crouched down beside her. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. What else?&rdquo;<br>Jasmine took another deep breath and concentrated with every ounce of her being. She squeezed her eyes so tight, she saw little bursts of color. Bursts like fat fists. Fat fists like bright blooms. The heady aroma wrapped around Jasmine, filling her lungs, her veins with the throbbing scent.<br>&ldquo;What do you see, Jas?&rdquo; her mother prompted.<br>&ldquo;I see&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;the flowers Daddy brought you for your birthday, only&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;brighter.&rdquo;<br>Her mother&rsquo;s delighted laughter sounded like music. &ldquo;You can open your eyes now.&rdquo;<br>She did, feeling a rush of triumph. She had done it. She had made her mom laugh.<br>But when she opened her eyes, her mom was gone. Luc was gone. She was alone in a lush forest where the trees seemed to be whispering to each other. If she listened hard enough, she could make out what they said, except for an annoying whine coming from overhead.<br>&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo; The sharp bite of panic put an edge in her voice.<br>An ache started in her stomach, like she hadn&rsquo;t eaten for a week, and she doubled over from the pain.<br>Blood pounded in her ears, drowning out all other sounds.<br>Then a voice called to her out of the fog. Luc? She tried calling out, but her mouth wouldn&rsquo;t form words.<br>The whining returned, louder and filled with rage. It filled her head, pushed to get out until she thought her body would explode. In a moment of clarity, she knew what was happening.<br>She was dying.<br>&ldquo;Jas, I&rsquo;m coming.&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&rdquo; It was Luc.<br>But before he reached her, she fell.<br>Jasmine jolted awake, gasping for air. It took her a second to recognize that she was in her own bed, her own room. The heavy perfume that had haunted her dream clung to her sheets and her hair.<br>Outside her window, the sun had begun to rise, and the sky was alight with streaks of red and orange. Cracks in the plaster ceiling revealed intricate patterns, spidering outward into a twisted mass, like tree limbs in winter. Someone had made coffee and the aroma made her feel nauseated.<br>Jasmine sat up slowly, waiting for the usual fuzzy-headedness that followed getting high, but there was none. In fact, things were sharper than they&rsquo;d ever been.<br>Except for her memory. Her memory was a blank. Had she partied too hard?<br>Carefully, she pushed the blanket aside and swung her legs over the side of the bed. Her muscles ached as she stretched her arms overhead. Jas waited for the room to tilt, for the bile to rise in her throat. But it didn&rsquo;t happen. She scanned her desk for her phone, but it was nowhere in sight. The clock on her nightstand read 8:42 a.m.<br>What the hell had happened? How had she ended up back in bed? What had she taken last night? She was hangover-free, at least. She felt clear, alert.<br>So why couldn&rsquo;t she remember?<br>Jasmine slipped on a pair of jeans that were slung over the chair. She looked at herself in the mirror on the back of her closet door. Her hair was a wild dark mess splayed out in a million directions, but her skin looked oddly glowing, as though she were standing in a patch of sunlight.<br>She shook her head. It was as if a curtain had been pulled over her memory. She could catch only glimpses, snippets of images, when the curtain fluttered.<br>T.J.<br>She was meeting him at the marina, but why?<br>Jasmine grabbed her favorite threadbare black sweater on her way out of the room. It was June in San Francisco and she was freezing. Maybe she&rsquo;d been sick. Fever or flu or something. It would explain the whacked-out dreams she&rsquo;d had.<br>Jasmine walked into the kitchen and found Luc sitting at their tiny table, absently looking out the window. There was an untouched piece of toast in front of him. Coffee was brewing, but it barely masked the scent of stale cigarette smoke.<br>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said. He looked up, relief evident on his face.<br>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo; He pulled out the chair next to him and motioned for her to sit.<br>Uh-oh. Luc was in serious mode. His eyes were bloodshot and there were dark circles beneath them. It reminded her too much of when she&rsquo;d woken up in the hospital after her overdose.<br>Oh God, had it happened again? Why couldn&rsquo;t she remember anything? Everything was a haze, and her last clear recollection was of Friday night. She&rsquo;d gone to meet T.J. to break it off with him.<br>&ldquo;Am I in trouble?&rdquo; Her voice was hoarse, like it hadn&rsquo;t been used in awhile.<br>&ldquo;What? No. Not at all.&rdquo; He shifted in the cracked plastic chair and looked at her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;glad you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;What happened last night? I went to the marina, but after that&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&rdquo;<br>Luc shook his head. It put her on edge when he was quiet like this--like there was bad news he was trying to break to her. Like when he had to explain to her that their mom had died.<br>Wait. Had someone died?<br>Jasmine looked around the apartment. Dad wasn&rsquo;t on the couch, where he could usually be found sleeping off a hangover. Dread pooled in her stomach.<br>&ldquo;Dad?&rdquo; The word squeezed out through her tight throat. &ldquo;Did something happen to Dad?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; Luc said. &ldquo;He checked into some residential detox program.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He what?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He decided he wanted to get sober,&rdquo; Luc said, poking at the toast. &ldquo;After you came home he said he wanted to get sober for us.&rdquo;<br>Jas couldn&rsquo;t understand how casually her brother was treating the news. Their dad was not the kind of man who asked for help, who admitted to an addiction.<br>&ldquo;Which hospital? I need to see this for myself.&rdquo; She stood up and immediately felt dizzy, like the floor was dropping out from under her. She placed a hand on the table to steady herself.<br>&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; Luc said, standing to ease her back into the chair. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going anywhere. Not yet, at least. The roads are still a mess and you&rsquo;ve been gone for two days--&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Two days? It&rsquo;s Saturday,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;What are you talking about? And why are the roads a mess?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Jas, it&rsquo;s Sunday,&rdquo; Luc said. &ldquo;And there was an earthquake&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; she insisted. Nothing felt familiar. The single bulb over their heads flickered; she felt a sting of pain as if the light shot straight through her brain. This was worse than a hangover, she was sure. She rubbed her throbbing temple and tried to focus.<br>Why couldn&rsquo;t she remember what had happened after the marina? If she went to see T.J., it was possible she took something--but she hadn&rsquo;t wanted to take anything after the overdose. Not ever again.<br>&ldquo;What happened to me, Luc? It wasn&rsquo;t drugs again, was it?&rdquo; She had to be sure.<br>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He scrubbed his fingers through his hair, exhaled deeply. &ldquo;I found you at the rotunda. There was this woman, Miranda&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&rdquo; He cut himself off. &ldquo;You know what? It&rsquo;s not really important. The important thing is that you&rsquo;re home and that you&rsquo;re careful from now on.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;How can I be careful if I don&rsquo;t know what happened?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Jas, so much has happened in the last couple of days.&rdquo; He closed his eyes and took a ragged breath in. &ldquo;Can we talk about this later?&rdquo;<br>The last thing she wanted to do was talk about it later. He was keeping something from her and she wanted answers--now. But she could tell that Luc was upset. He&rsquo;d done so much for her over the years, taken care of her when their dad hadn&rsquo;t. If he needed time, she would give it to him.<br>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; she said as she leaned back in the chair. &ldquo;But I need to get out of this apartment.&rdquo;<br><br>Luc had been more overprotective than ever, and it had taken a whole lot of convincing for him to stay home. He looked exhausted anyway, and Jasmine needed to be alone to think. She walked to the end of the street, where a large dump truck sat rumbling. Jasmine could smell the diesel in the air as men in yellow hardhats moved around the street, patching gaps in the sidewalk. A lamppost sagged close to the ground, and the fence of a parking lot bowed out toward the street.<br>California Pacific Medical Center was in walking distance, but she moved slowly, still recovering from the headache. She wondered about her dad&rsquo;s sudden change of heart. Why check himself into a program now? She could barely remember that warm, caring father--the one who threw her up in the air and called her his princess. Maybe deep down, she had always hoped he&rsquo;d come back.<br>Jasmine passed a small caf&eacute; and could almost smell the roasted beans and buttery pastries. Her stomach churned, but she couldn&rsquo;t be sure if it was the smell of food or her own nerves. What if her dad wasn&rsquo;t really there? Or worse, what if he was sicker than Luc had suggested?<br>A deep pain returned to her temples, and Jasmine rubbed at the spots with her fingers. The light and noise drove tiny knives into her skull. The sounds of construction surrounded her--men drilling into the concrete and dump trucks collecting debris. It was too much. Every sound built on another until it reached a crescendo.<br>Jas walked faster, and she caught her breath when the hospital entrance came into sight. She had been brought here when she overdosed, and hoped to never come back. And now, here she was.<br>She needed to sit down for a minute, to tune everything out.<br>The doors whooshed open and Jasmine walked to the reception desk, leaning on it as she regained her senses. The smell of chemicals made her stomach flip.<br>&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; the woman at the desk asked. She looked concerned.<br>&ldquo;Yes--yes, of course,&rdquo; Jasmine stammered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to see a patient. Jack Simmons?&rdquo;<br>The woman nodded, then tapped on her keyboard. Jasmine looked around and realized how chaotic it was. Nurses and doctors hurried up and down the hallways, and the waiting room was overrun with people. A man was being treated in the hallway, a nurse in green scrubs wrapping a white bandage around his head. A doctor in a lab coat pushed along a woman in a wheelchair, barely missing Jasmine&rsquo;s foot.<br>Jas swallowed uncomfortably.<br>&ldquo;Room one twenty-nine,&rdquo; the woman behind the desk said. &ldquo;Down the hall, take the first right, and then push through the double doors and take a left.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Jasmine said. She willed her feet to move down the hallway. The deeper she went into the hospital, the stronger the smell of disinfectant was. It clawed at her throat, and she had to cover her mouth and put her head down.<br>The gray tiles under her feet didn&rsquo;t change as she walked, so she turned left and started to count them. When she got to twenty-two, she looked up and saw that she was only steps away from the room number the woman at the front desk had given her.<br>One twenty-nine.<br>Jasmine stood at the doorway. A soft beep-beep came from a machine at her father&rsquo;s bedside. The overwhelming scent of antiseptic filled her lungs.<br>This was a mistake. She turned and almost ran into a nurse.<br>&ldquo;Hello. Are you a relative?&rdquo; the nurse asked.<br>&ldquo;His daughter,&rdquo; Jasmine managed to get out around her constricted throat. &ldquo;Is he okay?&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s suffering from severe alcohol withdrawal. It&rsquo;s a good thing he checked himself into our detoxification program when he did.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;And how long will he be here?&rdquo; She avoided looking in her father&rsquo;s direction. He looked small and sickly against the white sheets of the hospital bed.<br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll need to meet with a mental-health professional. Then he&rsquo;ll begin a weeklong inpatient stay.&rdquo; The woman placed her tray down and checked his monitor. &ldquo;He was given a sedative to help with the withdrawal symptoms for now, but you can say hello if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; Jas said, backing away from the bed.<br>&ldquo;But there are no visitors allowed during the program.&#8200;.&#8200;.&#8200;.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;You said it was a week long?&rdquo; Jas asked. &ldquo;I can wait until he&rsquo;s out.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d gone a week without seeing her dad before. At least he was here instead of passed out at O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s pub. She didn&rsquo;t want to say hello; she wanted to run away as fast as possible. The lights overhead made dots dance in her vision, and the sickly-sweet scent of hand sanitizer coated her tongue. She needed to get out, now.<br>She turned and ran.<br>At the end of the hall, she saw a bright red Exit sign and focused on it.<br>The doors exploded open under her hands.<br>Outside, she hesitated for just a second before turning left and running faster. Her only thought was to put distance between herself and the hospital as quickly as possible. She ran down Sacramento, turned right onto Fillmore, and then left, where a tilted sign indicated she was now on Clay Street.<br>She slowed to a walk, amazed that she didn&rsquo;t even feel winded. Luc always made fun of her for being a sloth, just because she didn&rsquo;t see the point of running up and down a field and kicking a ball into a net. And it was true she did fake illnesses a lot to get out of gym class. One time she&rsquo;d even claimed she was coming down with whooping cough.<br>Since when could she run so fast?<br>She felt strangely alive, buzzing. Beneath the squealing of tires and occasional blaring of alarms and car horns, it was as though the air itself was speaking to her. She felt connected to everything--to the people lighting a fire in the alleyway as she passed by, to an old lady walking across the street, to the old lady&rsquo;s small dog. She could feel them, could feel what they were feeling. Hunger. Loneliness. Curiosity. She could suddenly sense all of it around her, as though the whole world&rsquo;s volume had been turned up.",

      excerpt:
        "<p>Chapter 1</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>A Name</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mouse was the youngest of thirteen children. He was also the smallest. His mother had given the other twelve mouse pups quite ordinary names, like Bill or Jane.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>But when she looked at her last-born and saw that he was only half as big as his brothers and sisters, she said to herself, &ldquo;He should have an important-sounding name to make up for his lack of size. On second thought, he should have two important-sounding names. But what should they be?&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Now, it so happened that this particular mother mouse lived in a house belonging to a lady who played the piano. It was a grand piano that stood close to a living room wall, so that its left front leg almost touched the molding. In the molding, hidden from the human eye by the piano leg, was a hole. In this hole lived the mother mouse (whose name was Mary).</p><p>&#160;</p><p>One night, when the lady of the house had played a final tune on the piano and gone to bed, Mary came out of the hole in the molding. She ran up the left front leg and onto the keyboard, which as usual had been left open, and bounced along over the keys. But even though she was heavy with young, she was still much too light to make any noise.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Then she saw that a single sheet of music had been left lying on the piano stool.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;Just what I need to start making my nest with,&rdquo; said Mary Mouse, and by pushing at the sheet (a piece of piano music by Mozart) with her little forepaws, she managed to send it sailing down to the floor. Because it was too big to drag through the mousehole, she cut it up into smaller pieces with her sharp teeth and pulled the pieces inside.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Over the next day Mary chewed these small pieces of paper into shreds, and with them built herself a most comfortable nest. In this, in due course, she gave birth to her thirteen pups. Only when they were several days old, and she had made the decision that the thirteenth and littlest must have not one but two names, and important-sounding names at that, did something catch her eye.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>It was a scrap of the sheet music that had somehow escaped being chewed up, and it had some writing on it.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Mary got out of her nest to inspect it. It said:</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mo</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Mary gave a squeak of delight. &ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo; she cried to all the blind and naked pups. Then she softly whispered in the littlest one&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;This name was specially designed for you, dear. I feel it in my bones. Why, to be sure, the last three letters of the third word are missing, but there&rsquo;s no doubt what they were. The smallest you may be, but these names will make you the greatest, Wolfgang Amadeus Mouse!&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>A Joke</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>A few weeks later the mouse pups began to venture out of the hole in the molding at night. Before long they learned to climb up the left front leg of the grand piano, and they played on the keyboard.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>In particular they liked to race along the keys. Sometimes they were flat races along the fifty-two white keys from bass to treble, and sometimes they were hurdle races over the thirty-six raised black keys. Some nights one pup would win, some nights another, but Wolfgang Amadeus, being so small, was always last. He found the hurdles difficult to get over, and quite often in the flat races the rush of his bigger brothers and sisters running past him would cause him to lose his footing on the slippery white keys and fall to the floor.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Luckily the room was thickly carpeted, and he would fall very lightly, usually landing on his feet without harm. But the others of course just laughed as they peered over the edge and looked down on him.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>They were not very nice to him, partly on account of his lack of size, partly because it seemed to them that he was his mother&rsquo;s favorite, but mostly on account of his long name. All the time they heard Mary Mouse&rsquo;s anxious voice crying, &ldquo;Wolfgang Amadeus! Wolfgang Amadeus! Where are you? Are you all right? Did you hurt yourself falling off the piano, Wolfgang Amadeus?&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>At first Bill and Jane and Tom and Ann and all the rest teased their little brother--out of their mother&rsquo;s earshot--about his strange long name, and they even made up a rhyme that they squeaked at him all together (especially every time he fell off the piano).</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Who is small and meek and mild?</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Who is Mommy&rsquo;s favorite child?</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Who&rsquo;s no bigger than a louse?</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mouse!</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>All this made Wolfgang Amadeus unhappy, and one day he said to his mother, &ldquo;Mommy, why do I have to have such a long name when all the others have short ones?&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;Because yours is an important-sounding one, Wolfgang Amadeus,&rdquo; replied Mary, &ldquo;and you are going to grow up to be an important mouse. You cannot have a short name.&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>But in the end he did, given to him by the other pups.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>They had been playing another one of their favorite games, which took place on top of the grand piano. They would line up on the curved edge at the back of the instrument, and then each one in turn would see how far he or she could slide across its highly polished gleaming surface.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>One after another they would run and then slide on their fat furry little tummies. The object was to reach the straight front edge of the piano top without falling over and down onto the keyboard below. Sometimes they did fall over, but it was only a short drop and they would soon scramble back up again, squeaking with laughter.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>One night when they were playing this sliding game, one of them called out to another, &ldquo;Look at that Wolfgang Amadeus! He&rsquo;s hopeless! He never gets more than halfway across. He can&rsquo;t get up enough speed. His legs aren&rsquo;t long enough!&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing long about him,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s his name. I can&rsquo;t get my tongue around it. It&rsquo;s too much of a mouseful.&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, okay. Let&rsquo;s shorten it.&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;What shall we call him, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;Just Wolf.&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;Wolf?&rdquo; cried the other voices. &ldquo;What a joke! Tee-hee-hee! A mouse called Wolf!&rdquo; And they all giggled at their little brother, not caring, as usual, whether his feelings were hurt.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>They could not know that in fact he was delighted.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>A Song</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Wolf was even more delighted when his twelve brothers and sisters left home.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>For some time Mary Mouse&rsquo;s milk supply had been dwindling, and the pups had become used to accompanying their mother on her nightly scrounge. Around the house they would go in the wee hours of the night, especially to the kitchen and the dining room. They traveled by a system of mouseways, searching the floors and tables and cupboards for anything edible.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Soon the bolder ones stopped coming back to the hole by the piano leg, and before long it was only Wolf who returned home. He felt safer with his mother, and she was pleased to have him still at home with her. He in turn was pleased that she had become used to hearing the others use his shortened name, and now did so too, only addressing him as &ldquo;Wolfgang Amadeus&rdquo; if she was angry with him (which was seldom).</p><p>&#160;</p><p>All through the first weeks of his life Wolf had been used to hearing the sound of the piano, for the lady of the house played every day.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>The other pups grumbled at the music.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;What a racket!&rdquo; they muttered to one another. &ldquo;How are we expected to get a good day&rsquo;s sleep?&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>But Wolf grew to like the noise very much, and now, alone (Mary slept through it), he began to listen carefully to the melodies.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>The lady usually played her piano twice each day--in the late morning and then again in the early evening. The evening recital was the one Wolf enjoyed most, because by then he was rested and awake. He began sitting in the mouth of the hole by the piano leg and listening to the music above his head.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>He found that even when the playing stopped, he could still hear a particular tune inside his head, and he would hum it to himself--in a kind of silent hum--as he followed his mother about on the night&rsquo;s foraging.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish mice could sing,&rdquo; he said to his mother, &ldquo;instead of just squeaking. I&rsquo;d love to be able to sing.&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Mary had not had a very successful scavenge and was tired and hungry.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;Mice .&#8200;.&#8200;. sing?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a stupid child, Wolfgang Amadeus.&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Now she&rsquo;s annoyed at me, thought Wolf, and he said no more on the subject. But he couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about it. The next day, in fact, he actually dreamed that he was singing.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>When he awoke, it was early afternoon, a time, had he known it, when the lady of the house always had a little nap after her lunch. Mary Mouse was also fast asleep, so Wolf crept quietly out of the mousehole, scaled the piano leg, walked along the keyboard, and sat down on middle C, just below the elegant lettering that said:</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Steinway &amp; Sons</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>He sat there thinking of a particular tune. It was a favorite of the lady&rsquo;s and she often played it, so he knew it by heart.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>If only mice could sing, thought Wolf. Now is the perfect moment, here is the perfect place, and this is the perfect song for me. He sighed.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps, though I can&rsquo;t sing it, I could try to squeak it.&rdquo; And he threw back his head and opened his mouth.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Then, to his total surprise, out of that little mouth came a high clear lovely little voice that sang every note of the melody to perfection. Wolf was singing like a bird, except no songbird in the world could have sung as beautifully.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;La-la&#8209;la!&rdquo; he caroled, for of course he knew no words to the music. But it did not matter, for by chance the piece he had chosen was from a book of folk tunes by Mendelssohn called Songs Without Words.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Long and loudly sang Wolf, repeating the melody again and again in the ecstasy of discovery that to say mice could not sing was not entirely true. One mouse could! But before he finally fell silent, others in the house were awakened by his long, loud solo.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Mary came out of a deep sleep and her hole and climbed the piano leg. Her mouth fell open in utter amazement, but no sound came from it.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>In various holes in various rooms Wolf&rsquo;s brothers and sisters grumbled at this strange noise that had awakened them.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Snoozing on her bed, the lady of the house thought she heard, somewhere downstairs, a familiar tune by Mendelssohn, decided she&rsquo;d been dreaming, and went back to sleep.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>But there was one pair of ears in the kitchen that caught the sound of Wolf&rsquo;s singing and aroused in their owner a certain curiosity. The cat jumped out of its bed beside the stove and stretched, spreading its claws wide before padding silently toward the living room.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>A Trap</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;Beautiful, Wolf. That was quite beautiful!&rdquo; cried Mary as the song came to an end. &ldquo;Oh! To think that I am the mother of the world&rsquo;s first singing mouse!&rdquo; And she ran along the keyboard to nuzzle her child affectionately.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a genius!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sing me something else, like a good boy.&rdquo;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;What would you like, Mommy?&rdquo; asked Wolf, but his mother did not answer.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Instead she suddenly crouched on the keys, still as a stone, her hair on end, her eyes bulging in obvious terror as she stared over the singer&rsquo;s shoulder.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Looking quickly behind him, Wolf saw the cat creeping across the carpet, head raised, yellow eyes staring up at the two mice on the piano. It gathered itself to spring.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Wolf saw immediately that jumping down to the floor would be suicide. The cat would catch one or both of them before they had time to reach the safety of their hole.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&ldquo;Quick, Mommy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; And with a mighty effort he scrabbled his way up over steinway &amp; sons and into the body of the grand piano, Mary hard on his heels.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>It is doubtful that the mice might somehow have been able to escape the cat in the network of taut wires that formed the piano strings, but Fate now took a hand in the proceedings.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>The cat&rsquo;s leap took it up onto the right-hand edge of the piano, but its landing was an unfortunate one, for the cat hit the prop stick (which held the top of the instrument open) and dislodged it. Supported no longer, the heavy top began to fall, and instantly, with that lightning reaction cats have, the attacker wheeled to jump back down again.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>But the cat was not quite quick enough.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>The top of the piano fell shut, not with quite the loud crash you would have expected, but with a slightly more muffled noise. Caught between the top and the body of the piano was an inch of ginger tail. Then the force of the fall of the piano top made it bounce just a fraction. The cat fell free and rushed from the living room at full speed.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>In the days that followed, the squashed and bruised tip of the cat&rsquo;s tail healed, but in its mind the cat carried the scars of that encounter for the rest of its life.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Far from realizing that what had happened was its own fault, the cat felt sure, then and forever, that it was the mice who had engineered the whole thing.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>It was the mice who woke me up with their noise, the cat thought, who lured me into the room, who jumped inside the piano knowing that I would follow. It was the mice who somehow sprang that trap that caught my tail in its jaws.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Little did Mary and Wolf realize, but from that moment on the cat would never again pose a threat to them. From then on, unknown to them, they were to live in a house with a cat that was forevermore scared stiff of mice.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Now all they knew was that they were prisoners.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Fearfully they explored the blackness of the inside of the closed piano, looking for some way out but finding none. All the time, as they crisscrossed the tightly stretched strings, their feet made a discordant jingle of tiny sounds, a little tinkling sonata for two mice and piano.</p>",

      excerpt:
        "One look into the bathtub was enough to send her hurrying to get Angus. As usual, he awoke from the deepest of sleeps with his mind instantly tuned to his chief pleasure in life.<br><br>&quot;I'm hungry,&quot; said Angus. &quot;Is breakfast ready?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ssssshh!&quot; said Kirstie. &quot;Don't talk so loud. We mustn't wake Mother or Grumble.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because it's hatched. The thing. In the bathtub.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Blow me down!&quot; said Angus.<br><br>Angus enjoyed using what he thought to be terrible swear words, and his father, on his last shore leave, had taught him a careful selection of sailors' oaths.<br><br>They crept into the bathroom and stood side by side, gazing into the water. <br><br>&quot;Look!&quot; said Kirstie.<br><br>&quot;Shiver my timbers!&quot; said Angus.<br><br>The giant mermaid's purse lay on the bottom at the plug hole end like a sunken wreck. Wrecked it was, too, with a gaping hole in one side where something had emerged. At the other end of the bathtub swam that something.<br><br>When Kirstie was a grown woman with a family of her own, her children would ask her time and again to describe what it was she saw in the bathtub that early March morning when she was eight years of age.<br><br>&quot;It was a little animal,&quot; she told them, &quot;&quot;such as neither I nor your Uncle Angus had ever seen before. Such as no one in the world had ever seen before, in fact. In size, it was about as big as a newborn kitten but quite a different shape. The first thing you noticed about it was its head, which was sticking out of the water on the end of quite a long neck. More than anything, it looked like a horse's head, with wide nostrils like a horse and even a suggestion of pricked ears. But its body was more like a turtle's. I don't mean it had a shell--it had kind of warty skin like a toad's, greeny grayish in color--but it had four flippers like a turtle has. And then it had a tail like a crocodile's. But just like you usually look at people's faces before you notice anything else about them, the thing that struck us was the look of its head. We didn't think about a crocodile or a toad or a turtle. We thought about a little horse.&quot;<br><br>Now, as Kirstie and Angus watched, the creature, which had been eyeing them in silence, dived with a plop, swam underwater with strong strokes of its little flippers, and surfaced again right in front of them. It looked up at them and chirruped. <br><br>&quot;What does it want?&quot; Kirstie said. The answer to this question was obvious to someone like Angus.<br><br>&quot;Food, of course,&quot; he said. &quot;It's hungry, like me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What shall we give it? What do you suppose it will eat? What do you suppose it is anyway? We don't even know what sort of animal it is.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's a monster,&quot; said Angus confidently. He had a number of picture books about monsters, and obviously this was one of them.<br><br>&quot;But monsters are big,&quot; Kirstie said.<br><br>Angus sighed. &quot;This isn't a monster monster,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a baby one.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A baby sea monster!&quot; said Kirstie. &quot;Well, then, it would eat fish, wouldn't it? We'll have to catch some fish for it.&quot;<br><br>A happy smile lit up Angus's round face. &quot;We don't need to,&quot; he said. &quot;There's some sardines in the pantry. I like sardines.&quot;<br><br>Opening the sardine can was difficult, but Kirstie managed to turn the key far enough to winkle one out, and they tiptoed upstairs again, carrying it on a saucer. <br><br>&quot;Don't give it everything. It might not like it,&quot; said Angus hopefully, but when Kirstie pulled off a bit of sardine with her fingers and dropped it into the bathtub, the little animal snapped it up and gulped it down and chirruped loudly for more.<br><br>&quot;It likes it,&quot; said Angus dolefully. He broke off another piece of fish, his hand moving automatically toward his mouth, but Kirstie said &quot;Angus!&quot; sharply, so he dropped it in the tub, contenting himself with licking the oil off his fingers. And, one after the other, they fed the creature the rest of the sardine. Then they went down to the pantry again to see if they could get another one out of the can.&quot;<br><br>With a great effort, for the key was very stiff to turn, Kirstie had at last got the can fully open when suddenly they heard footsteps on the stairs and Mother came into the kitchen.<br><br>&quot;Kirstie!&quot; she said. &quot;Whatever are you up to? Who told you you could help yourself to sardines--and long before breakfast time, too?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's for our sea monster,&quot; said Angus.<br><br>&quot;Don't be so silly, Angus!&quot; said Mother sharply. &quot;Look at your fingers, all oily, you greedy little boy! And you, Kirstie, you're old enough to know better!&quot;<br><br>&quot;We haven't eaten any, Mother, honestly,&quot; said Kirstie. &quot;And we have got a sea monster, truly we have.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now you listen to me, Kirstie,&quot; said Mother. &quot;Whatever it is that you two have brought home--a lobster, a crab, whatever it is that you're wasting my expensive sardines on--you will take it straight back, d'you hear me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, no, Mother!&quot; cried Kirstie. &quot;Please not.&quot;<br><br>&quot;First thing after breakfast it goes back in the sea,&quot; said Mother firmly. &quot;Where is it anyway?&quot;<br><br>&quot;In the bathtub,&quot; said Angus.<br><br>&quot;In the bathtub!&quot; cried Mother. &quot;Oh, no!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's quite happy there,&quot; said Angus.<br><br>&quot;Well, that's more than your grandfather will be by now. As I came down, I saw him going along the corridor with his towel and his shaving kit. He'll have a fit!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Specially if it's still hungry,&quot; said Angus. <br><br>But when the three of them reached the bathroom, the door was open and there was Grumble kneeling by the bathtub. With his bald head and his droopy mustache he looked like a walrus about to take a dip. He was staring silently at the little animal as it paddled about the water, now glistening with sardine oil. To their amazement they saw that he was smiling broadly. Grumble, smiling!<br><br>&quot;It's that thing you found on the beach after the storm, isn't it Kirstie?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Grumble. It hatched in the night.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I made her put salt in the water,&quot; said Angus.<br><br>&quot;I doubt you need have bothered with that,&quot; said Grumble. &quot;It's an air-breathing beastie, you see, like a seal. Fresh water or salt, I doubt it matters, so long as it has plenty of fish to eat.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We've given it a sardine,&quot; said Kirstie. <br><br>Grumble got to his feet. &quot;You've a clever couple of kids here,&quot; he said to Mother. &quot;How I wish I could have found such a thing when I was their age. There were many stories then of this creature and I believed all of them, but I never thought I'd see one.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You sound as though you know what this thing is,&quot; said Mother.<br><br>&quot;I should,&quot; said Grumble. &quot;Wasn't I born and brought up on the banks of Loch Morar? And wasn't there supposed to be one of these living in that very loch?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What is it, Grumble?&quot; asked Kirstie.<br><br>&quot;Before I tell you,&quot; said Grumble, &quot;you must promise faithfully to tell no one outside the family. Not a word to any of your friends at school. Understand?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Kirstie. &quot;Cross my heart.&quot; She crossed it. Angus crossed his stomach, perhaps by mistake, but possibly because it was to him the most important organ. <br><br>&quot;Right,&quot; said Grumble. &quot;Then I'll tell you. It's a monster.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I told you,&quot; said Angus. <br><br>&quot;Always there've been tales of sightings of such a beastie, sometimes at sea, more often in a loch,&quot; said Grumble. &quot;Oh, when I was a boy, how I longed to see the kelpie.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is that what it's called?&quot; said Kirstie. <br><br>&quot;That's one name for it,&quot; said Grumble, &quot;but the other is the one that I like. Most folks call it the Water Horse.&quot;",

But the next day, after a night in the bathtub, a mysterious little creature is born: part turtle, part horse, part frog, with an alligator tail. Only Kirstie's grandpa knows its true identity: a Water Horse, the sea monster of Scottish legend. The creature becomes a family pet, tamable and lovable, though with a huge appetite. As he grows and grows, the family must decide where to place him, somewhere away from those who would exploit him or, worse, accidentally become his dinner; perhaps Loch Ness would be safest. This well-written, fast-paced fantasy combines a popular subject with appealing, distinctive characters, humor, and drama.

      excerpt:
        "The Instructions<br>When the city of Ember was just built and not yet inhabited, the Chief Builder and the Assistant Builder, both of them weary, sat down to speak of the future.<br><br>&ldquo;They must not leave the city for at least two hundred years,&rdquo; said the Chief Builder. &ldquo;Or perhaps two hundred and twenty.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Is that long enough?&rdquo; asked his Assistant.<br><br>&ldquo;It should be. We can&rsquo;t know for sure.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;And when the time comes,&rdquo; said the Assistant, &ldquo;how will they know what to do?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll provide them with instructions, of course,&rdquo; the Chief Builder replied.<br><br>&ldquo;But who will keep the instructions? Who can we trust to keep them safe and secret all that time?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;The mayor of the city will keep the instructions,&rdquo; said the Chief Builder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put them in a box with a timed lock, set to open on the proper date.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;And will we tell the mayor what&rsquo; s in the box?&rdquo; the Assistant asked.<br><br>&ldquo;No, just that it&rsquo;s information they won&rsquo;t need and must not see until the box opens of its own accord.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;So the first mayor will pass the box to the next mayor, and that one to the next, and so on down through the years, all of them keeping it secret, all that time?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What else can we do?&rdquo; asked the Chief Builder. &ldquo;Nothing about this endeavor is certain. There may be no one left in the city by then or no safe place for them to come back to.&rdquo;<br><br>So the first mayor of Ember was given the box, told to guard it carefully, and solemnly sworn to secrecy. When she grew old, and her time as mayor was up, she explained about the box to her successor, who also kept the secret carefully, as did the next mayor. Things went as planned for many years. But the seventh mayor of Ember was less honorable than the ones who&rsquo;d come before him, and more desperate. He was ill&ndash;he had the coughing sickness that was common in the city then&ndash;and he thought the box might hold a secret that would save his life. He took it from its hiding place in the basement of the Gathering Hall and brought it home with him, where he attacked it with a hammer.<br><br>But his strength was failing by then. All he managed to do was dent the lid a little. And before he could return the box to its official hiding place or tell his successor about it, he died. The box ended up at the back of a closet, shoved behind some old bags and bundles. There it sat, unnoticed, year after year, until its time arrived, and the lock quietly clicked open.<br><br>Chapter 1<br>Assignment Day<br>In the city of Ember, the sky was always dark. The only light came from great floodlamps mounted on the buildings and at the tops of poles in the middle of the larger squares. When the lights were on, they cast a yellowish glow over the streets; people walking by threw long shadows that shortened and then stretched out again. When the lights were off, as they were between nine at night and six in the morning, the city was so dark that people might as well have been wearing blindfolds.<br><br>Sometimes darkness fell in the middle of the day. The city of Ember was old, and everything in it, including the power lines, was in need of repair. So now and then the lights would flicker and go out. These were terrible moments for the people of Ember. As they came to a halt in the middle of the street or stood stock still in their houses, afraid to move in the utter blackness, they were reminded of something they preferred not to think about: that some day the lights of the city might go out and never come back on.<br><br>But most of the time life proceeded as it always had. Grown people did their work, and younger people, until they reached the age of twelve, went to school. On the last day of their final year, which was called Assignment Day, they were given jobs to do.<br><br>The graduating students occupied Room 8 of the Ember School. On Assignment Day of the year 241, this classroom, usually noisy first thing in the morning, was completely silent. All twenty-four students sat upright and still in the desks they had grown too big for. They were waiting.<br><br>The desks were arranged in four rows of six, one behind the other. In the last row sat a slender girl named Lina Mayfleet. She was winding a strand of her long, dark hair around her finger, winding and unwinding it again and again. Sometimes she plucked at a loose thread on her ragged cape or bent over to pull on her socks, which were loose and tended to slide down around her ankles. One of her feet tapped the floor softly.<br><br>In the second row was a boy named Doon Harrow. He sat with his shoulders hunched, his eyes squeezed shut in concentration, and his hands clasped tightly together. His hair looked rumpled, as if he hadn&rsquo;t combed it for a while. He had dark, thick eyebrows, which made him look serious at the best of times, and when he was anxious or angry came together to form a straight line across his forehead. His brown corduroy jacket was so old that its ridges had flattened out.<br><br>Both the girl and the boy were making urgent wishes. Doon&rsquo;s wish was very specific. He repeated it over and over again, his lips moving slightly, as if he could make it come true by saying it a thousand times. Lina was making her wish in pictures rather than in words. In her mind&rsquo;s eye, she saw herself running through the streets of the city in a red jacket. She made this picture as bright and real as she could.",

        "Jeanne DuPrau has been a teacher, an editor, and a technical writer. <i>The City of Ember</i> is her first novel. She is currently working on the sequel at her home in Menlo Park, California, where she keeps a big garden and a small dog.",

        "The City of Ember is the only light in the dark world. Beyond Ember, the darkness goes on forever in all directions. When the children of the city of Ember finish school, they begin work at 12 years of age. . . .<br><br>Lina Mayfleet desperately wants to be a messenger. Messengers spend their days outside, running from one corner of the city to the other. Instead, she draws the dreaded job of Pipeworks laborer, which means she&#8217;ll be stuck in tunnels deep underground.<br><br>Doon Harrow draws messenger&#8212;and asks to trade with Lina! Doon wants to be underground. That&#8217;s where the generator is, and Doon has ideas about how to fix it. For as long as anyone can remember, the great lights of Ember have kept the endless darkness that surrounds the city at bay. But now the lights are starting to flicker.<br><br>When Lina finds fragments of an ancient parchment, she and Doon put the pieces together to discover a message that seems to be directions out of the city.",
      rgdiscussion:
        "<p>1. Doon and Lina like very different things. Doon wants to work in the Pipeworks; Lina yearns to be a messenger. Doon likes to study how things work. Lina likes to run and explore. But their friendship grows because they are ultimately searching for the same thing. How do they complement one another and help one another develop through the novel?</p><p>2. Earth today has many environmental and social issues. What sort of problems could have led to the building of the City of Ember?</p><p>3. Clary tells Lina, &#8220;Everyone has some darkness inside.&#8221; (p. 168) Light and color both play very key roles in the novel. In what ways, other than the failing street lamps, are color and light important?</p><p>4. The possibility of never-ending darkness changes many of Lina&#8217;s friends and many of the townspeople. She discovers that her friend Lizzie has begun to accept things from Looper, who is stealing things from the storerooms. Why does Lina turn down the gifts that Lizzie offers her? Do you think that she was right to do so?</p><p>5. The city of Ember was built when people were worried that the human race might not survive. Do you think this was a good plan?</p><p>6. The mayor is the most corrupt character in the novel. He squelches the thirst for knowledge and limits freedom, yet the majority of the townspeople just accept his behavior. Why do you think they act this way? What other actions might they have taken?</p><p>7. People react in various ways when they feel threatened. How do the people of Ember react to danger? Have you seen people reacting to danger in these ways? How are Poppy&#8217;s actions important to the plot?</p><p>8. At the end of the novel, Lina, Doon, and Poppy have discovered a sunlit earth. What do you think will become of them in the sequel? Do you think that there are other people on the surface?</p>",

      excerpt:
        "The Instructions<br>When the city of Ember was just built and not yet inhabited, the Chief Builder and the Assistant Builder, both of them weary, sat down to speak of the future.<br><br>&ldquo;They must not leave the city for at least two hundred years,&rdquo; said the Chief Builder. &ldquo;Or perhaps two hundred and twenty.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Is that long enough?&rdquo; asked his Assistant.<br><br>&ldquo;It should be. We can&rsquo;t know for sure.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;And when the time comes,&rdquo; said the Assistant, &ldquo;how will they know what to do?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll provide them with instructions, of course,&rdquo; the Chief Builder replied.<br><br>&ldquo;But who will keep the instructions? Who can we trust to keep them safe and secret all that time?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;The mayor of the city will keep the instructions,&rdquo; said the Chief Builder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put them in a box with a timed lock, set to open on the proper date.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;And will we tell the mayor what&rsquo; s in the box?&rdquo; the Assistant asked.<br><br>&ldquo;No, just that it&rsquo;s information they won&rsquo;t need and must not see until the box opens of its own accord.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;So the first mayor will pass the box to the next mayor, and that one to the next, and so on down through the years, all of them keeping it secret, all that time?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What else can we do?&rdquo; asked the Chief Builder. &ldquo;Nothing about this endeavor is certain. There may be no one left in the city by then or no safe place for them to come back to.&rdquo;<br><br>So the first mayor of Ember was given the box, told to guard it carefully, and solemnly sworn to secrecy. When she grew old, and her time as mayor was up, she explained about the box to her successor, who also kept the secret carefully, as did the next mayor. Things went as planned for many years. But the seventh mayor of Ember was less honorable than the ones who&rsquo;d come before him, and more desperate. He was ill&ndash;he had the coughing sickness that was common in the city then&ndash;and he thought the box might hold a secret that would save his life. He took it from its hiding place in the basement of the Gathering Hall and brought it home with him, where he attacked it with a hammer.<br><br>But his strength was failing by then. All he managed to do was dent the lid a little. And before he could return the box to its official hiding place or tell his successor about it, he died. The box ended up at the back of a closet, shoved behind some old bags and bundles. There it sat, unnoticed, year after year, until its time arrived, and the lock quietly clicked open.<br><br>Chapter 1<br>Assignment Day<br>In the city of Ember, the sky was always dark. The only light came from great floodlamps mounted on the buildings and at the tops of poles in the middle of the larger squares. When the lights were on, they cast a yellowish glow over the streets; people walking by threw long shadows that shortened and then stretched out again. When the lights were off, as they were between nine at night and six in the morning, the city was so dark that people might as well have been wearing blindfolds.<br><br>Sometimes darkness fell in the middle of the day. The city of Ember was old, and everything in it, including the power lines, was in need of repair. So now and then the lights would flicker and go out. These were terrible moments for the people of Ember. As they came to a halt in the middle of the street or stood stock still in their houses, afraid to move in the utter blackness, they were reminded of something they preferred not to think about: that some day the lights of the city might go out and never come back on.<br><br>But most of the time life proceeded as it always had. Grown people did their work, and younger people, until they reached the age of twelve, went to school. On the last day of their final year, which was called Assignment Day, they were given jobs to do.<br><br>The graduating students occupied Room 8 of the Ember School. On Assignment Day of the year 241, this classroom, usually noisy first thing in the morning, was completely silent. All twenty-four students sat upright and still in the desks they had grown too big for. They were waiting.<br><br>The desks were arranged in four rows of six, one behind the other. In the last row sat a slender girl named Lina Mayfleet. She was winding a strand of her long, dark hair around her finger, winding and unwinding it again and again. Sometimes she plucked at a loose thread on her ragged cape or bent over to pull on her socks, which were loose and tended to slide down around her ankles. One of her feet tapped the floor softly.<br><br>In the second row was a boy named Doon Harrow. He sat with his shoulders hunched, his eyes squeezed shut in concentration, and his hands clasped tightly together. His hair looked rumpled, as if he hadn&rsquo;t combed it for a while. He had dark, thick eyebrows, which made him look serious at the best of times, and when he was anxious or angry came together to form a straight line across his forehead. His brown corduroy jacket was so old that its ridges had flattened out.<br><br>Both the girl and the boy were making urgent wishes. Doon&rsquo;s wish was very specific. He repeated it over and over again, his lips moving slightly, as if he could make it come true by saying it a thousand times. Lina was making her wish in pictures rather than in words. In her mind&rsquo;s eye, she saw herself running through the streets of the city in a red jacket. She made this picture as bright and real as she could.",

      excerpt:
        "THE ENCHANTED SLEEPER<br><br>In a valley shaded with rhododendrons, close to the snow line, where a stream milky with meltwater splashed and where doves and linnets flew among the immense pines, lay a cave, half, hidden by the crag above and the stiff heavy leaves that clustered below.<br><br>The woods were full of sound: the stream between the rocks, the wind among the needles of the pine branches, the chitter of insects and the cries of small arboreal mammals, as well as the birdsong; and from time to time a stronger gust of wind would make one of the branches of a cedar or a fir move against another and groan like a cello.<br><br>It was a place of brilliant sunlight, never undappled. Shafts of lemon-gold brilliance lanced down to the forest floor between bars and pools of brown-green shade; and the light was never still, never constant, because drifting mist would often float among the treetops, filtering all the sunlight to a pearly sheen and brushing every pine cone with moisture that glistened when the mist lifted. Sometimes the wetness in the clouds condensed into tiny drops half mist and half rain, which floated downward rather than fell, making a soft rustling patter among the millions of needles.<br><br>There was a narrow path beside the stream, which led from a village-little more than a cluster of herdsmen's dwellings - at the foot of the valley to a half-ruined shrine near the glacier at its head, a place where faded silken flags streamed out in the Perpetual winds from the high mountains, and offerings of  barley cakes and dried tea were placed by pious villagers. An odd effect of the light, the ice, and the vapor enveloped the head of the valley in perpetual rainbows.<br><br>The cave lay some way above the path. Many years before, a holy man had lived there, meditating and fasting and praying, and the place was venerated for the sake of his memory. It was thirty feet or so deep, with a dry floor: an ideal den for a bear or a wolf, but the only creatures living in it for years had been birds and bats.<br><br>But the form that was crouching inside the entrance, his black eyes watching this way and that, his sharp ears pricked, was neither bird nor bat. The sunlight lay heavy and rich on his lustrous golden fur, and his monkey hands turned a pine cone this way and that, snapping off the scales with sharp fingers and scratching out the sweet nuts.<br><br>Behind him, just beyond the point where the sunlight reached, Mrs. Coulter was heating some water in a small pan over a naphtha stove. Her daemon uttered a warning murmur and Mrs. Coulter looked up.<br><br>Coming along the forest path was a young village girl. Mrs. Coulter knew who she was: Ama had been bringing her food for some days now. Mrs. Coulter had let it be known when she first arrived that she was a holy woman engaged in meditation and prayer, and under a vow never to speak to a man. Ama was the only person whose visits she accepted.<br><br>This time, though, the girl wasn't alone. Her father was with her, and while Ama climbed up to the cave, he waited a little way off.<br><br>Ama came to the cave entrance and bowed.<br><br>&quot;My father sends me with prayers for your goodwill,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;Greetings, child,&quot; said Mrs. Coulter.<br><br>The girl was carrying a bundle wrapped in faded cotton, which she laid at Mrs. Coulter's feet. Then she held out a little bunch of flowers, a dozen or so anemones bound with a cotton thread, and began to speak in a rapid, nervous voice. Mrs. Coulter understood some of the language of these mountain people, but it would never do to let them know how much. So she smiled and motioned to the girl to close her lips and to watch their two daemons. The golden monkey was holding out his little black hand, and Ama's butterfly daemon was fluttering closer and closer until he settled on a horny forefinger.<br><br>The monkey brought him slowly to his ear, and Mrs. Coulter felt a tiny stream of understanding flow into her mind, clarifying the girl's words. The villagers were happy for a holy woman, such as herself, to take refuge in the cave, but it was rumored 'that she had a companion with her who was in some way dangerous and powerful.<br><br>It was that which made the villagers afraid. Was this other Steing Mrs. Coulter's master, or her servant? Did she mean harm? Why was she there in the first place? Were they going to stay long? Ama conveyed these questions with a thousand misgivings.<br><br>A novel answer occurred to Mrs. Coulter as the daemon's understanding filtered into hers. She could tell the truth. Not all of it, naturally, but some. She felt a little quiver of laughter at the idea, but kept it out of her voice as she explained:<br><br>&quot;Yes, there is someone else with me. But there is nothing to be afraid of. She is my daughter, and she is under a spell that made her fall asleep. We have come here to hide from the enchanter who put the spell on her, while I try to cure her and keep her from harm. Come and see her, if you like.&quot;<br><br>Ama was half-soothed by Mrs. Coulter's soft voice, and half afraid still; and the talk of enchanters and spells added to the awe she felt. But the golden monkey was holding her daemon so gently, and she was curious, besides, so she followed Mrs. Coulter into the cave.<br><br>Her father, on the path below, took a step forward, and his crow daemon raised her wings once or twice, but he stayed where he was.<br><br>Mrs. Coulter lit a candle, because the light was fading rapidly, and led Ama to the back of the cave. Ama's eyes glittered widely in the gloom, and her hands were moving together in a repetitive gesture of finger on thumb, finger on thumb, to ward off danger by confusing the evil spirits.<br><br>&quot;You see?&quot; said Mrs. Coulter. &quot;She can do no harm. There's nothing to be afraid of.&quot;",

        "The Amber Spyglass brings the intrigue of The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife to a heart-stopping conclusion, marking the final volume as the most powerful of the trilogy. <br><br>Along with the return of Lyra, Will, Mrs. Coulter, Lord Asriel, Dr. Mary Malone, and the armored bear Iorek Byrnison, The Amber Spyglass introduces a host of new characters: the Mulefa, mysterious wheeled creatures with the power to see Dust; Gallivespian Lord Roke, a hand-high spymaster to Lord Asriel; and Metatron, a fierce and mighty angel. <br><br>And with rich characters and mounting suspense come startling revelations, too: the painful price Lyra must pay to walk through the land of the dead, the haunting power of Dr. Malone's amber spyglass, and the names of who will live - and who will die - for love. And all the while, war rages in the Kingdom of Heaven - the shocking outcome of this brutal battle will uncover the secret of Dust. <br><br>In The Amber Spyglass, Philip Pullman deftly weaves the cliffhangers and mysteries of The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife into an earth- shattering conclusion - and confirms his fantasy trilogy as an undoubted and enduring classic. The questions, discussion topics, and author information that follow are intended to enhance your group's reading of each of the books in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy.",
      rgdiscussion:
        "<p>1. Dust, Dark Matter, and Sraf are three different names for the same material. How do these names reflect the different worlds they come from? What attitudes and feelings does each society have about this material?</p><p>2. Why do you think the subtle knife breaks when Will thinks of his mother? When the knife breaks, do you think Mrs. Coulter is aware of her influence on Will? Are there any connections between Mrs. Coulter and Will's mother?</p><p>3. In each book of the <i>His Dark Materials</i> trilogy, a special device (such as the alethiometer, the subtle knife, or the amber spyglass) is introduced in connection with the pursuit of Dust. What are the different properties of each instrument? How does each instrument reflect the personality of the person that uses it (i.e., Lyra, Will, and Dr. Malone)?</p><p>4. When asked to mend the subtle knife, Iorek is hesitant: &quot;Sometimes a tool may have other uses that you don't know. Sometimes in doing what you intend you also do what the knife intends, without knowing.&quot; What do you think the knife's intentions are? Based on these intentions, who do you think created the knife and for what purpose?</p><p>5. By the end of <i>The Amber Spyglass</i>, what similiarites can you see between Lyra and Mrs. Coulter? How is Lyra's storytelling different from Mrs. Coulter's lying?</p><p>6. In <i>The Amber Spyglass</i>, Mrs. Coulter goes through a dramatic transformation as her maternal feelings for Lyra break through to the surface. What is the catalyst for this change?</p>",

      rgabout:
        "The questions, discussion topics, and author information that follow are intended to enhance your group's reading of <b>The Golden Compass</b>. We hope that this guide will help you to navigate - alongside the story's young protagonist, Lyra Belacqua - Philip Pullman's richly imagined universe, populated by armored bears, gyptians, witches, and human beings, whose d&#230;mons are never far from their side. <br>D&#230;mons are one of the most striking, charming, and powerful images in <b>The Golden Compass</b>. These spirit-creatures, which seem like physical representations of the human soul, can change form to reflect the myriad of emotional states their humans go through as children. But in adulthood, each d&#230;mon settles into the animal form that best reflects the inner nature of its human counterpart. It is in this unusual and imaginative creation that Pullman turns his sharpest mirror back onto his readers, helping us to imagine our own souls as precious, living extensions of ourselves that we can love, challenge, or even betray. <br><b>The Golden Compass </b>is a complex story that turns on a simple word: &quot;Dust.&quot; This Dust does not gather in the unswept corners of Jordan College, Lyra's Oxford home. Rather, this Dust seems to reveal - or perhaps contain - the thing that makes each human being a unique creature. The concept of Dust provokes fear in some; others realize that mastery over Dust could be the source of great power. Although she does not quite realize it, Lyra - along with her d&#230;mon Pantalaimon - finds her life inextricably entangled with the exploration of Dust. And as her understanding of Dust and her mastery over a mysterious tool called the alethiometer increases, the dangerous journey that she seems destined to make takes some astounding twists and turns.",
      rgdiscussion:
        "<p>1. The author tells us that <b>The Golden Compass</b> takes place &quot;in a universe like ours, but different in many ways.&quot; How do you think Lyra's universe relates to ours?</p><p>2. What is a d&#230;mon? How do they make humans different from other creatures? Why do you think servants' d&#230;mons are always dogs? What sort of d&#230;mons might your friends, relatives, classmates, or coworkers have? Describe your own d&#230;mon.</p><p>3. The world of <b>The Golden Compass</b> is ruled by the Church. However, the nature of its power is unclear. What power do you think the Church holds over its people?</p><p>4. On pages 89-90, the General Oblation Board is explained in reference to the historical sacrifice of children to cloistered life. &quot;Oblation&quot; refers to the act of making a religious offering. What offering does the General Oblation Board make and to whom?</p><p>5. Human knowledge and experience are made physical in Dust. What other psychological, intellectual, or spiritual activities does the author physicalize?</p><p>6. What is the relationship between &quot;severing&quot; and death? Is the author using this fantasy to explore the notion of psychic or moral death?</p><p>7. Why do you think the author stresses that Lyra is not an imaginative child? Why would &quot;imagination&quot; be dangerous to her? How would it affect her understanding of the alethiometer? Is Lyra a truth-seeker? Who is Lyra Belacqua and/or what does she symbolize?</p><p>8. In what ways is gender a significant or stratifying element in the novel? Why do you think all witches are female? Why are d&#230;mons usually the opposite gender of their human counterparts? Is the fact that Lyra is a girl-child relevant to the themes of the story?</p><p>9. Alongside human society in <b>The Golden Compass</b>, there exists the community of the armored bears, who have their own hierarchical structure and moral code. In one way Svalbard seems little more than an interesting foil to the human condition, yet the bear kingdom is also a final destination, the site of the story's climactic conclusion. What do you think is the author's purpose in inventing - and exploring - the world of the armored bear?</p><p>10. The author has filled this novel with binary imagery: person-d&#230;mon; mother-father; Iorek-Iofur; Lyra's universe-the universe in the Aurora. What other binarisms can you find in the structure, landscape imagery, and vocabulary of this fantasy? How do these dualistic elements affect the novel's larger themes?</p><p>11. Discuss Lyra's &quot;betrayal&quot; of Roger in relation to other betrayals that occur in the novel. Has reading <b>The Golden Compass</b> altered your understanding of the act of betrayal?</p><p>12. Are Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter in collusion or are they fighting each other? How and in what way? </p><p>13. Curiously absent from <b>The Golden Compass</b> are four words that are prevalent in most fantasy adventures: right, wrong, good, and evil. Can these terms be applied to this story? How and why, or why not?</p><p>14. On the last page of the book, Lyra and Pantalaimon recognize that they are still &quot;one being; both of us are one.&quot; The expression resonates with a phrase from marriage ceremonies. Contrast this moment in the story with the preceding interplay between Lyra's parents.</p><p>15. <b>The Golden Compass</b> is the first book in the trilogy<b> His Dark Materials</b>, which gets its name from a passage in John Milton's <b>Paradise Lost</b>, quoted at the beginning of the novel. Philip Pullman has said, &quot;Milton's angels are not seriously meant to be believed - beings with wings and halos and white robes. They are psychological qualities, conceived and pictured as personalities. With them, Milton tells one of the central tales of our world: the story of the temptation and fall of humankind.&quot; Discuss the passage from <b>Paradise Lost</b> and this statement from the author in relation to <b>The Golden Compass</b>.</p><p>16.

      excerpt:
        "Will tugged at his mother's hand and said, &quot;Come <i>on,</i>&#160;come <br><i>on</i>&#160; ...&quot;<br><br>But his mother hung back. She was still afraid. Will looked up and down <br>the narrow street in the evening light, along the little terrace of <br>houses, each behind its tiny garden and its box hedge, with the sun <br>glaring off the windows of one side and leaving the other in shadow. There <br>wasn't much time. People would be having their meal about now, and soon <br>there would be other children around, to stare and comment and notice. It <br>was dangerous to wait, but all he could do was persuade her, as usual.<br><br>&quot;Mum, let's go in and see Mrs. Cooper,&quot; he said. &quot;Look, we're nearly <br>there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mrs. Cooper?&quot; she said doubtfully.<br><br>But he was already ringing the bell. He had to put down the bag to do it, <br>because his other hand still held his mother's. It might have bothered him <br>at twelve years of age to be seen holding his mother's hand, but he knew <br>what would happen to her if he didn't.<br><br>The door opened, and there was the stooped elderly figure of the piano <br>teacher, with the scent of lavender water about her as he remembered.<br><br>&quot;Who's that? Is that William?&quot; the old lady said. &quot;I haven't seen you for <br>over a year. What do you want, dear?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I want to come in, please, and bring my mother,&quot; he said firmly.<br><br>Mrs. Cooper looked at the woman with the untidy hair and the distracted <br>half-smile, and at the boy with the fierce, unhappy glare in his eyes, the <br>tight-set lips, the jutting jaw. And then she saw that Mrs. Parry, Will's <br>mother, had put makeup on one eye but not on the other. And she hadn't <br>noticed. And neither had Will. Something was wrong.<br><br>&quot;Well ...&quot; she said, and stepped aside to make room in the narrow hall.<br><br>Will looked up and down the road before closing the door, and Mrs. Cooper <br>saw how tightly Mrs. Parry was clinging to her son's hand, and how <br>tenderly he guided her into the sitting room where the piano was (of <br>course, that was the only room he knew); and she noticed that Mrs. Parry's <br>clothes smelled slightly musty, as if they'd been too long in the washing <br>machine before drying; and how similar the two of them looked as they sat <br>on the sofa with the evening sun full on their faces, their broad <br>cheekbones, their wide eyes, their straight black brows.<br><br>&quot;What is it, William?&quot; the old lady said. &quot;What's the matter?&quot;<br><br>&quot;My mother needs somewhere to stay for a few days,&quot; he said. &quot;It's too <br>difficult to look after her at home just now. I don't mean she's ill. <br>She's just kind of confused and muddled, and she gets a bit worried. She <br>won't be hard to look after. She just needs someone to be kind to her, and <br>I think you could do that quite easily, probably.&quot;<br><br>The woman was looking at her son without seeming to understand, and Mrs. <br>Cooper saw a bruise on her cheek. Will hadn't taken his eyes off Mrs. <br>Cooper, and his expression was desperate.<br><br>&quot;She won't be expensive,&quot; he went on. &quot;I've brought some packets of food, <br>enough to last, I should think. You could have some of it too. She won't <br>mind sharing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But ...I don't know if I should ...Doesn't she need a doctor?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No! She's not ill.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But there must be someone who can ...I mean, isn't there a neighbor or <br>someone in the family--&quot;<br><br>&quot;We haven't got any family. Only us. And the neighbors are too busy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What about the social services? I don't mean to put you off, dear, but--&quot;<br><br>&quot;No! No. She just needs a bit of help. I can't do it myself for a little <br>while, but I won't be long. I'm going to ...I've got things to do. But <br>I'll be back soon, and I'll take her home again, I promise. You won't have <br>to do it for long.&quot;<br><br>The mother was looking at her son with such trust, and he turned and <br>smiled at her with such love and reassurance, that Mrs. Cooper couldn't <br>say no.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, turning to Mrs. Parry, &quot;I'm sure it won't matter for a <br>day or so. You can have my daughter's room, dear. She's in Australia. She <br>won't be needing it again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Will, and stood up as if he were in a hurry to leave.<br><br>&quot;But where are you going to be?&quot; said Mrs. Cooper.<br><br>&quot;I'm going to be staying with a friend,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll phone up as often <br>as I can. I've got your number. It'll be all right.&quot;<br><br>His mother was looking at him, bewildered. He bent over and kissed her <br>clumsily.<br><br>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; he said. &quot;Mrs. Cooper will look after you better than me, <br>honest. And I'll phone up and talk to you tomorrow.&quot;<br><br>They hugged tightly, and then Will kissed her again and gently unfastened <br>her arms from his neck before going to the front door. Mrs. Cooper could <br>see he was upset, because his eyes were glistening, but he turned, <br>remembering his manners, and held out his hand.<br><br>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; he said, &quot;and thank you very much.&quot;<br><br>&quot;William,&quot; she said, &quot;I wish you'd tell me what the matter is--&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's a bit complicated,&quot; he said, &quot;but she won't be any trouble, <br>honestly.&quot;<br><br>That wasn't what she meant, and both of them knew it; but somehow Will was <br>in charge of this business, whatever it was. The old lady thought she'd <br>never seen a child so implacable.<br><br>He turned away, already thinking about the empty house.<br><br><br><br><br>The close where Will and his mother lived was a loop of road in a modern <br>estate with a dozen identical houses, of which theirs was by far the <br>shabbiest. The front garden was just a patch of weedy grass; his mother <br>had planted some shrubs earlier in the year, but they'd shriveled and died <br>for lack of watering. As Will came around the corner, his cat, Moxie, rose <br>up from her favorite spot under the still-living hydrangea and stretched <br>before greeting him with a soft meow and butting her head against his leg.<br><br>He picked her up and whispered, &quot;Have they come back, Moxie? Have you seen <br>them?&quot;<br><br>The house was silent. In the last of the evening light the man across the <br>road was washing his car, but he took no notice of Will, and Will didn't <br>look at him. The less notice people took, the better.<br><br>Holding Moxie against his chest, he unlocked the door and went in quickly. <br>Then he listened very carefully before putting her down. There was nothing <br>to hear; the house was empty.<br><br>He opened a tin for Moxie and left her to eat in the kitchen. How long <br>before the men came back? There was no way of telling, so he'd better move <br>quickly. He went upstairs and began to search.<br><br>He was looking for a battered green leather writing case. There are a <br>surprising number of places to hide something that size even in any <br>ordinary modern house; you don't need secret panels and extensive cellars <br>in order to make something hard to find. Will searched his mother's <br>bedroom first, ashamed to be looking through the drawers where she kept <br>her underclothes, and then he worked systematically through the rest of <br>the rooms upstairs, even his own. Moxie came to see what he was doing and <br>sat and cleaned herself nearby, for company.<br><br>But he didn't find it.<br><br>By that time it was dark, and he was hungry. He made himself baked beans <br>on toast and sat at the kitchen table wondering about the best order to <br>look through the downstairs rooms.<br><br>As he was finishing his meal, the phone rang.<br><br>He sat absolutely still, his heart thumping. He counted: twenty-six rings, <br>and then it stopped. He put his plate in the sink and started to search <br>again.<br><br><br><br><br>Four hours later he still hadn't found the green leather case. It was half <br>past one, and he was exhausted. He lay on his bed fully clothed and fell <br>asleep at once, his dreams tense and crowded, his mother's unhappy, <br>frightened face always there just out of reach.<br><br>And almost at once, it seemed (though he'd been asleep for nearly three <br>hours), he woke up knowing two things simultaneously.<br><br>First, he knew where the case was. And second, he knew that the men were <br>downstairs, opening the kitchen door.<br><br>He lifted Moxie out of the way and softly hushed her sleepy protest. Then <br>he swung his legs over the side of the bed and put on his shoes, straining <br>every nerve to hear the sounds from downstairs. They were very quiet <br>sounds: a chair being lifted and replaced, a short whisper, the creak of a <br>floorboard.<br><br>Moving more silently than the men were, he left his bedroom and tiptoed to <br>the spare room at the top of the stairs. It wasn't quite pitch-dark, and <br>in the ghostly gray predawn light he could see the old treadle sewing <br>machine. He'd been through the room thoroughly only hours before, but he'd <br>forgotten the compartment at the side of the sewing machine, where all the <br>patterns and bobbins were kept.<br><br>He felt for it delicately, listening all the while. The men were moving <br>about downstairs, and Will could see a dim flicker of light that might <br>have been a flashlight at the edge of the door.<br><br>Then he found the catch of the compartment and clicked it open, and there, <br>just as he'd known it would be, was the leather writing case.<br><br>And now what could he do? He crouched in the dimness, heart pounding, <br>listening hard.<br><br>The two men were in the hall downstairs. He heard one of them say quietly, <br>&quot;Come on. I can hear the milkman down the road.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's not here, though,&quot; said the other voice. &quot;We'll have to look <br>upstairs.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Go on, then. Don't hang about.&quot;<br><br>Will braced himself as he heard the quiet creak of the top step. The man <br>was making no noise at all, but he couldn't help the creak if he wasn't <br>expecting it. Then there was a pause. A very thin beam of flashlight swept <br>along the floor outside. Will saw it through the crack.<br><br>Then the door began to move. Will waited till the man was framed in the <br>open doorway, and then exploded up out of the dark and crashed into the <br>intruder's belly.<br><br>But neither of them saw the cat.<br><br>As the man had reached the top step, Moxie had come silently out of the <br>bedroom and stood with raised tail just behind the man's legs, ready to <br>rub herself against them. The man, who was trained and fit and hard, could <br>have dealt with Will, but the cat was in the way, and as the man tried to <br>move back, he tripped over her. With a sharp gasp he fell backward down <br>the stairs and crashed his head brutally against the hall table.<br><br>Will heard a hideous crack, and didn't stop to wonder about it. Clutching <br>the writing case, he swung himself down the banister, leaping over the <br>man's body that lay twitching and crumpled at the foot of the flight, <br>seized the tattered tote bag from the table, and was out of the front door <br>and away before the other man could do more than come out of the living <br>room and stare.<br><br>Even in his fear and haste Will wondered why the other man didn't shout <br>after him, or chase him. They'd be after him soon, though, with their cars <br>and their cell phones. The only thing to do was run.<br><br>He saw the milkman turning into the close, the lights of his electric cart <br>pallid in the dawn glimmer that was already filling the sky. Will jumped <br>over the fence into the next-door garden, down the passage beside the <br>house, over the next garden wall, across a dew-wet lawn, through the <br>hedge, and into the tangle of shrubs and trees between the housing estate <br>and the main road. There he crawled under a bush and lay panting and <br>trembling. It was too early to be out on the road: wait till later, when <br>the rush hour started.<br><br>He couldn't get out of his mind the crack as the man's head struck the <br>table, and the way his neck was bent so far and in such a wrong way, and <br>the dreadful twitching of his limbs. The man was dead. He'd killed him.<br><br>He couldn't get it out of his mind, but he had to. There was quite enough <br>to think about. His mother: would she really be safe where she was? Mrs. <br>Cooper wouldn't tell, would she? Even if Will didn't turn up as he'd said <br>he would? Because he couldn't, now that he'd killed someone.<br><br>And Moxie. Who'd feed Moxie? Would Moxie worry about where they were? <br>Would she try to follow them?<br><br>It was getting lighter by the minute. It was light enough already to check <br>through the things in the tote bag: his mother's purse, the latest letter <br>from the lawyer, the road map of southern England, chocolate bars, <br>toothpaste, spare socks and pants. And the green leather writing case.<br><br>Everything was there. Everything was going according to plan, really.<br><br>Except that he'd killed someone.<br><br><br><br><br>Will had first realized his mother was different from other people, and <br>that he had to look after her, when he was seven. They were in a <br>supermarket, and they were playing a game: they were allowed to put an <br>item in the cart only when no one was looking. It was Will's job to look <br>all around and whisper &quot;Now,&quot; and she would snatch a tin or a packet from <br>the shelf and put it silently into the cart. When things were in there <br>they were safe, because they became invisible.<br><br>It was a good game, and it went on for a long time, because this was a <br>Saturday morning and the shop was full, but they were good at it and <br>worked well together. They trusted each other. Will loved his mother very <br>much and often told her so, and she told him the same.<br><br>So when they reached the checkout Will was excited and happy because <br>they'd nearly won. And when his mother couldn't find her purse, that was <br>part of the game too, even when she said the enemies must have stolen it; <br>but Will was getting tired by this time, and hungry too, and Mummy wasn't <br>so happy anymore. She was really frightened, and they went around and <br>around putting things back on the shelves, but this time they had to be <br>extra careful because the enemies were tracking them down by means of her <br>credit card numbers, which they knew because they had her purse....<br><br>And Will got more and more frightened himself. He realized how clever his <br>mother had been to make this real danger into a game so that he wouldn't <br>be alarmed, and how, now that he knew the truth, he had to pretend not to <br>be frightened, so as to reassure her.<br><br>So the little boy pretended it was a game still, so she didn't have to <br>worry that he was frightened, and they went home without any shopping, but <br>safe from the enemies; and then Will found the purse on the hall table <br>anyway. On Monday they went to the bank and closed her account, and opened <br>another somewhere else, just to be sure. Thus the danger passed.<br><br>But sometime during the next few months, Will realized slowly and <br>unwillingly that those enemies of his mother's were not in the world out <br>there, but in her mind. That made them no less real, no less frightening <br>and dangerous; it just meant he had to protect her even more carefully. <br>And from the moment in the supermarket when he had realized he must <br>pretend in order not to worry his mother, part of Will's mind was always <br>alert to her anxieties. He loved her so much he would have died to protect <br>her.<br><br>As for Will's father, he had vanished long before Will was able to <br>remember him. Will was passionately curious about his father, <br>&quot;Was he a rich man?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where did he go?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why did he go?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is he dead?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Will he come back?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What was he like?&quot;<br><br>The last question was the only one she could help him with. John Parry had <br>been a handsome man, a brave and clever officer in the Royal Marines, who <br>had left the army to become an explorer and lead expeditions to remote <br>parts of the world. Will thrilled to hear about this. No father could be <br>more exciting than an explorer. From then on, in all his games he had an <br>invisible companion: he and his father were together hacking through the <br>jungle, shading their eyes to gaze out across stormy seas from the deck of <br>their schooner, holding up a torch to decipher mysterious inscriptions in <br>a bat-infested cave. ...They were the best of friends, they saved each <br>other's life countless times, they laughed and talked together over <br>campfires long into the night.<br><br>But the older he got, the more Will began to wonder. Why were there no <br>pictures of his father in this part of the world or that, riding with <br>frost-bearded men on Arctic sledges or examining creeper-covered ruins in <br>the jungle? Had nothing survived of the trophies and curiosities he must <br>have brought home? Was nothing written about him in a book?<br><br>His mother didn't know. But one thing she had said stuck in his mind.<br><br>She said, &quot;One day, you'll follow in your father's footsteps. You're going <br>to be a great man too. You'll take up his mantle.&quot;<br><br>And though Will didn't know what that meant, he understood the sense of <br>it, and felt uplifted with pride and purpose. All his games were going to <br>come true. His father was alive, lost somewhere in the wild, and he was <br>going to rescue him and take up his mantle. ...It was worth living a <br>difficult life, if you had a great aim like that.<br><br>So he kept his mother's trouble secret. There were times when she was <br>calmer and clearer than others, and he took care to learn from her then <br>how to shop and cook and keep the house clean, so that he could do it when <br>she was confused and frightened. And he learned how to conceal himself, <br>too, how to remain unnoticed at school, how not to attract attention from <br>the neighbors, even when his mother was in such a state of fear and <br>madness that she could barely speak. What Will himself feared more than <br>anything was that the authorities would find out about her, and take her <br>away, and put him in a home among strangers. Any difficulty was better <br>than that. Because there came times when the darkness cleared from her <br>mind, and she was happy again, and she laughed at her fears and blessed <br>him for looking after her so well; and she was so full of love and <br>sweetness then that he could think of no better companion, and wanted <br>nothing more than to live with her alone forever.<br><br>But then the men came.<br><br>They weren't police, and they weren't social services, and they weren't <br>criminals--at least as far as Will could judge. They wouldn't tell him <br>what they wanted, in spite of his efforts to keep them away; they'd speak <br>only to his mother. And her state was fragile just then.<br><br>But he listened outside the door, and heard them ask about his father, and <br>felt his breath come more quickly.<br><br>The men wanted to know where John Parry had gone, and whether he'd sent <br>anything back to her, and when she'd last heard from him, and whether he'd <br>had contact with any foreign embassies. Will heard his mother getting more <br>and more distressed, and finally he ran into the room and told them to go.<br><br>He looked so fierce that neither of the men laughed, though he was so <br>young. They could easily have knocked him down, or held him off the floor <br>with one hand, but he was fearless, and his anger was hot and deadly.<br><br>So they left. Naturally, this episode strengthened Will's conviction: his <br>father was in trouble somewhere, and only he could help. His games weren't <br>childish anymore, and he didn't play so openly. It was coming true, and he <br>had to be worthy of it.<br><br>And not long afterward the men came back, insisting that Will's mother had <br>something to tell them. They came when Will was at school, and one of them <br>kept her talking downstairs while the other searched the bedrooms. She <br>didn't realize what they were doing. But Will came home early and found <br>them, and once again he blazed at them, and once again they left.<br><br>They seemed to know that he wouldn't go to the police, for fear of losing <br>his mother to the authorities, and they got more and more persistent. <br>Finally they broke into the house when Will had gone to fetch his mother <br>home from the park. It was getting worse for her now, and she believed <br>that she had to touch every separate slat in every separate bench beside <br>the pond. Will would help her, to get it done quicker. When they got home <br>that day they saw the back of the men's car disappearing out of the close, <br>and he got inside to find that they'd been through the house and searched <br>most of the drawers and cupboards.<br><br>He knew what they were after. The green leather case was his mother's most <br>precious possession; he would never dream of looking through it, and he <br>didn't even know where she kept it. But he knew it contained letters, and <br>he knew she read them sometimes, and cried, and it was then that she <br>talked about his father. So Will supposed that this was what the men were <br>after, and knew he had to do something about it.<br><br>He decided first to find somewhere safe for his mother to stay. He thought <br>and thought, but he had no friends to ask, and the neighbors were already <br>suspicious, and the only person he thought he could trust was Mrs. Cooper. <br>Once his mother was safely there, he was going to find the green leather <br>case and look at what was in it, and then he was going to go to Oxford, <br>where he'd find the answer to some of his questions. But the men came too <br>soon.<br><br>And now he'd killed one of them.<br><br>So the police would be after him too.<br><br>Well, he was good at not being noticed. He'd have to <i>not be noticed <br></i>&#160;harder than he'd ever done in his life before, and keep it up as <br>long as he could, till either he found his father or they found him. And <br>if they found him first, he didn't care how many more of them he killed.<br><br><br><br><br>Later that day, toward midnight in fact, Will was walking out of the city <br>of Oxford, forty miles away. He was tired to his very bones. He had <br>hitchhiked, and ridden on two buses, and walked, and reached Oxford at six <br>in the evening, too late to do what he needed to do. He'd eaten at a <br>Burger King and gone to a cinema to hide (though what the film was, he <br>forgot even as he was watching it), and now he was walking along an <br>endless road through the suburbs, heading north.<br><br>No one had noticed him so far. But he was aware that he'd better find <br>somewhere to sleep before long, because the later it got, the more <br>noticeable he'd be. The trouble was that there was nowhere to hide in the <br>gardens of the comfortable houses along this road, and there was still no <br>sign of open country.<br><br>He came to a large traffic circle where the road going north crossed the <br>Oxford ring road going east and west. At this time of night there was very <br>little traffic, and the road where he stood was quiet, with comfortable <br>houses set back behind a wide expanse of grass on either side. Planted <br>along the grass at the road's edge were two lines of hornbeam trees, <br>odd-looking things with perfectly symmetrical close-leafed crowns, more <br>like children's drawings than like real trees. The streetlights made the <br>scene look artificial, like a stage set. Will was stupefied with <br>exhaustion, and he might have gone on to the north, or he might have laid <br>his head on the grass under one of those trees and slept; but as he stood <br>trying to clear his head, he saw a cat.<br><br>She was a tabby, like Moxie. She padded out of a garden on the Oxford side <br>of the road, where Will was standing. Will put down his tote bag and held <br>out his hand, and the cat came up to rub her head against his knuckles, <br>just as Moxie did. Of course, every cat behaved like that, but all the <br>same Will felt such a longing for home that tears scalded his eyes.<br><br>Eventually the cat turned away. This was night, and there was a territory <br>to patrol, there were mice to hunt. She padded across the road and toward <br>the bushes just beyond the hornbeam trees, and there she stopped.<br><br>Will, still watching, saw the cat behave curiously.<br><br>She reached out a paw to pat something in the air in front of her, <br>something quite invisible to Will. Then she leaped backward, back arched <br>and fur on end, tail held out stiffly. Will knew cat behavior. He watched <br>more alertly as the cat approached the spot again, just an empty patch of <br>grass between the hornbeams and the bushes of a garden hedge, and patted <br>the air once more.<br><br>Again she leaped back, but less far and with less alarm this time. After <br>another few seconds of sniffing, touching, and whisker twitching, <br>curiosity overcame wariness.<br><br>The cat stepped forward and vanished.<br><br>Will blinked. Then he stood still, close to the trunk of the nearest tree, <br>as a truck came around the circle and swept its lights over him. When it <br>had gone past, he crossed the road, keeping his eyes on the spot where the <br>cat had been investigating. It wasn't easy, because there was nothing to <br>fix on, but when he came to the place and cast about to look closely, he <br>saw it.<br><br>At least, he saw it from some angles. It looked as if someone had cut a <br>patch out of the air, about two yards from the edge of the road, a patch <br>roughly square in shape and less than a yard across. If you were level <br>with the patch so that it was edge-on, it was nearly invisible, and it was <br>completely invisible from behind. You could see it only from the side <br>nearest the road, and you couldn't see it easily even from there, because <br>all you could see through it was exactly the same kind of thing that lay <br>in front of it on this side: a patch of grass lit by a streetlight.<br><br>But Will knew without the slightest doubt that that patch of grass on the <br>other side was in a different world.<br><br>He couldn't possibly have said why. He knew it at once, as strongly as he <br>knew that fire burned and kindness was good. He was looking at something <br>profoundly alien.<br><br>And for that reason alone, it enticed him to stoop and look further. What <br>he saw made his head swim and his heart thump harder, but he didn't <br>hesitate: he pushed his tote bag through, and then scrambled through <br>himself, through the hole in the fabric of this world and into another.<br><br>He found himself standing under a row of trees. But not hornbeam trees: <br>these <br>were tall palms, and they were growing, like the trees in Oxford, in a row <br>along <br>the grass. But this was the center of a broad boulevard, and at the side <br>of <br>the boulevard was a line of caf&#233;s and small shops, all brightly <br>lit, all open, and all utterly silent and empty beneath a sky thick with <br>stars. The hot night was laden with the scent of flowers and with the salt <br>smell of the sea.<br><br>Will looked around carefully. Behind him the full moon shone down over a <br>distant prospect of great green hills, and on the slopes at the foot of <br>the hills there were houses with rich gardens, and an open parkland with <br>groves of trees and the white gleam of a classical temple.<br><br>Just beside him was that bare patch in the air, as hard to see from this <br>side as from the other, but definitely there. He bent to look through and <br>saw the road in Oxford, his own world. He turned away with a shudder: <br>whatever this new world was, it had to be better than what he'd just left. <br>With a dawning lightheadedness, the feeling that he was dreaming but awake <br>at the same time, he stood up and looked around for the cat, his guide.<br><br>She was nowhere in sight. No doubt she was already exploring those narrow <br>streets and gardens beyond the caf&#233;s whose lights were so inviting. <br>Will lifted up his tattered tote bag and walked slowly across the road <br>toward them, moving very carefully in case it all disappeared.<br><br>The air of the place had something Mediterranean or maybe Caribbean about <br>it. Will had never been out of England, so he couldn't compare it with <br>anywhere he knew, but it was the kind of place where people came out late <br>at night to eat and drink, to dance and enjoy music. Except that there was <br>no one here, and the silence was immense.<br><br>On the first corner he reached there stood a caf&#233;, with little green <br>tables on the pavement and a zinc-topped bar and an espresso machine. On <br>some of the tables glasses stood half-empty; in one ashtray a cigarette <br>had burned down to the butt; a plate of risotto stood next to a basket of <br>stale rolls as hard as cardboard.<br><br>He took a bottle of lemonade from the cooler behind the bar and then <br>thought for a moment before dropping a pound coin in the till. As soon as <br>he'd shut the till, he opened it again, realizing that the money in there <br>might say what this place was called. The currency was called the corona, <br>but he couldn't tell any more than that.<br><br>He put the money back and opened the bottle on the opener fixed to the <br>counter before leaving the caf&#233; and wandering down the street going <br>away from the boulevard. Little grocery shops and bakeries stood between <br>jewelers and florists and bead-curtained doors opening into private <br>houses, where wrought-iron balconies thick with flowers overhung the <br>narrow pavement, and where the silence, being enclosed, was even more <br>profound.<br><br>The streets were leading downward, and before very long they opened out <br>onto a broad avenue where more palm trees reached high into the air, the <br>underside of their leaves glowing in the streetlights.<br><br>On the other side of the avenue was the sea.<br>Will found himself facing a harbor enclosed from the left by a stone <br>breakwater and from the right by a headland on which a large building with <br>stone columns and wide steps and ornate balconies stood floodlit among <br>flowering trees and bushes. In the harbor one or two rowboats lay still at <br>anchor, and beyond the breakwater the starlight glittered on a calm sea.<br><br>By now Will's exhaustion had been wiped out. He was wide awake and <br>possessed by wonder. From time to time, on his way through the narrow <br>streets, he'd put out a hand to touch a wall or a doorway or the flowers <br>in a window box, and found them solid and convincing. Now he wanted to <br>touch the whole landscape in front of him, because it was too wide to take <br>in through his eyes alone. He stood still, breathing deeply, almost afraid.<br><br>He discovered that he was still holding the bottle he'd taken from the <br>caf&#233;. He drank from it, and it tasted like what it was, ice-cold <br>lemonade; and welcome, too, because the night air was hot.<br><br>He wandered along to the right, past hotels with awnings over brightly lit <br>entrances and bougainvillea flowering beside them, until he came to the <br>gardens on the little headland. The building in the trees with its ornate <br>facade lit by floodlights might have been an opera house. There were paths <br>leading here and there among the lamp-hung oleander trees, but not a sound <br>of life could be heard: no night birds singing, no insects, nothing but <br>Will's own footsteps.<br><br>The only sound he could hear came from the regular, quiet breaking of <br>delicate waves from the beach beyond the palm trees at the edge of the <br>garden. Will made his way there. The tide was halfway in, or halfway out, <br>and a row of pedal boats was drawn up on the soft white sand above the <br>high-water line. Every few seconds a tiny wave folded itself over at the <br>sea's edge before sliding back neatly under the next. Fifty yards or so <br>out on the calm water was a diving platform.<br><br>Will sat on the side of one of the pedal boa",

        "The questions, discussion topics, and author information that follow are intended to enhance your group's reading of <b>The Subtle Knife</b>. <b>The Subtle Knife</b> is Book Two of Philip Pullman's trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. In Book One, <b>The Golden Compass, </b>young Lyra Belacqua journeys through &quot;a universe like ours but different in many ways.&quot; The most striking difference between Lyra's world and ours is the existence of daemons. These spirit-creatures, physical manifestations of the human soul, can change shape until their human companions reach adolescence. Then each daemon settles into the animal form that best reflects the inner nature of its human counterpart.<br>In <b>The Golden Compass,</b> Lyra discovers that her mother, Mrs. Coulter, is conducting experiments in which children are severed from their daemons, turning them into emotionless, almost inhuman beings. Mrs. Coulter and her colleagues are doing this to learn more about a substance called &quot;Dust, &quot; which seems to accumulate on humans when they reach maturity. While many fear Dust, both Mrs. Coulter and Lyra's father, Lord Asriel, see it as the source of great power. <b>The Golden Compass</b> concludes with Lord Asriel harnessing the power of Dust to create an opening in the atmosphere of his world, forging a bridge to another universe. This he fearlessly crosses, leaving Mrs. Coulter behind. Lyra perceives that Dust is good and vows to discover its secrets with the help of her &quot;golden compass&quot;, or alethiometer, a truth-seeking device. And so Lyra and her daemon, Pantalaimon, follow Lord Asriel into the other world.<br><b>The Subtle Knife</b> begins in our own world, where Will Parry, driven by curiosity about his mysterious, missing father and concern for his vulnerable, disturbed mother, accidentally kills an intruder. While fleeing, he finds a &quot;window&quot; into a sunlit otherworld. What could be a better refuge than a hidden universe? But this universe is a strange, empty place: a city that seems to have been abandoned in such haste that food is left rotting on plates at a sidewalk cafe. The inhabitants of the city, Citt&#225;gazze, have fled from the invading Specters, ghostlike creatures that devour the souls of adults. But Specters are harmless and invisible to children, and soon Will meets another fugitive child in Citt&#225;gazze: Lyra. Although he does not know it, their lives are soon to become forever intertwined when Lyra's alethiometer gives her one simple command: Help Will find his father.<br>The richly imagined world of Book One seems almost quiet and simple when compared to the turmoil of Book Two. Here &quot;Dust&quot; is called &quot;dark matter&quot; and has been joined by a myriad of other complex phenomena, including the Specters and bene elim (angels). One protagonist has been replaced by two, Lyra and Will. Most significant of all, Lyra's truth-giving compass seems to pale in comparison to the power of Will's new acquisition, the subtle knife, the &#198;sah&#230;ttr, the knife that will cut ANYTHING. What can it mean to be the bearer of such an instrument?",
      rgdiscussion:
        "<p>1. What is wrong with Will's mother? Are her concerns real, imagined, or both? Why and how does Will protect her?</p><p>2. What does it mean when Lyra assumes Will's daemon is &quot;inside&quot;? Do the people in Will's world, our world, have daemons at all?</p><p>3. Why does Will's being a murderer enable Lyra to trust him? What characters do Serafina Pekkala and Lee Scoresby decide to trust, and is their trust warranted? In what other ways does trust play an important role in this novel?</p><p>4. How has Will learned to make himself unnoticed by others? Relate this to the witches' ability to make themselves invisible.</p><p>5. How do the Shadows that communicate with Lyra through the computer relate to dark matter and/or Dust? If Lyra can understand the Shadows as she understands the alethiometer, then is the computer also acting as a truth-giving device? What is the real origin of the Shadows' messages?</p><p>6. On page 188, Giacomo Paradisi tells Will the rules for bearing the subtle knife. Why do you think Will must &quot;never open without closing&quot;? What did Paradisi mean by &quot;a base purpose&quot;? Compare these formal guidelines to the instinctive rules Lyra obeys when using the alethiometer.</p><p>7. Why is it significant that the possessors of the alethiometer and the subtle knife are children? What is the difference between innocence and experience? What has happened to Mrs. Coulter's solders who have undergone intercision?</p><p>8. Lord Asriel is mentioned several times throughout the story, yet we never directly see him. He is planning a war that he cannot win without an object that he does not know exists. What does Lord Asriel symbolize in <b>The Subtle Knife</b>?</p><p>9. What did the &quot;Cave&quot; mean when it told Dr. Malone that she must be &quot;the serpent&quot;? Where do you think she is at the end of the story? Where is Lyra?</p><p>10. In what way can a knife that divides pathways between worlds and can sever bone, rock, and steel be called &quot;subtle&quot;?</p><p>11. <b>DISCUSSION TOPICS IF YOU HAVE READ THE GOLDEN COMPASS AND THE SUBTLE KNIFE</b><br>In Book One, Lyra is clearly a leader. In Book Two, she seems to have become a follower, a servant to Will's cause. Who is more powerful, Will or Lyra? Whose cause is more important? Is it the same cause?</p><p>12. Is the &quot;psychic death&quot; caused by severing the same as that caused by the Specters? Compare Tony Makarios and the servants at Bolvangar (Book One) to Tullio's actions after Will takes the subtle knife and the final thoughts of Lena Feldt (Book Two). Relate these to the &quot;natural&quot; deaths suffered by Lee Scoresby and John Parry.</p><p>13. Armored bears, witches, severed children and adults, cliff-ghasts, Spectres, and angels are beings with spiritual qualities different from humans. Why does the authorintroduce so many creatures with alternative soul-states?</p><p>14. By the end of The Subtle Knife, we have learned that both Will's father, John Parry/Stanislaus Grumman, and Lyra's father, Lord Asriel, are powerful men who have traveled between worlds. Yet one is called a shaman while the other is preparing to be a general. What is the relationship between these two men? Compare it to the relationship between Will and Lyra.</p><p>15. <b>The Golden Compass</b> takes place in a &quot;closed&quot; world where Lyra finds guidance through her newly-found alethiometer. In <b>The Subtle Knife</b>, boundaries between worlds have been broken, Lyra loses her alethiometer, and Will becomes the reluctant bearer of the knife. Explore the many parallels and opposites established between <b>The Golden Compass </b>and<b> The Subtle Knife</b>. How is the dualistic imagery of Lyra's and Will's worlds counterpointed by Citta&#225;gazze?</p><p>16. Citing a passage from John Miltons <b>Paradise Lost</b>, Philip Pullman has named his trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials.&quot; How might this citation, and the novels' emerging themes, relate to the following quote:<br>&quot;The prince of darkness is a gentleman.&quot; - William Shakespeare (King Lear)</p>",

      excerpt:
        "Eragon knelt in a bed of trampled reed grass and scanned the tracks with a practiced eye. The prints told him that the deer had been in the meadow only a half-hour before. Soon they would bed down. His target, a small doe with a pronounced limp in her left forefoot, was still with the herd. He was amazed she had made it so far without a wolf or bear catching her.<br><br> The sky was clear and dark, and a slight breeze stirred the air. A silvery cloud drifted over the mountains that surrounded him, its edges glowing with ruddy light cast from the harvest moon cradled between two peaks. Streams flowed down the mountains from stolid glaciers and glistening snowpacks. A brooding mist crept along the valley&rsquo;s floor, almost thick enough to obscure his feet.&#160;<br><br> Eragon was fifteen, less than a year from manhood. Dark eyebrows rested above his intense brown eyes. His clothes were worn from work. A hunting knife with a bone handle was sheathed at his belt, and a buckskin tube protected his yew bow from the mist. He carried a wood-frame pack.<br><br> The deer had led him deep into the Spine, a range of untamed mountains that extended up and down the land of Alaga&euml;sia. Strange tales and men often came from those mountains, usually boding ill. Despite that, Eragon did not fear the Spine&ndash;he was the only hunter near Carvahall who dared track game deep into its craggy recesses.&#160;<br><br> It was the third night of the hunt, and his food was half gone. If he did not fell the doe, he would be forced to return home empty- handed. His family needed the meat for the rapidly approaching winter and could not afford to buy it in Carvahall.<br><br> Eragon stood with quiet assurance in the dusky moonlight, then strode into the forest toward a glen where he was sure the deer would rest. The trees blocked the sky from view and cast feathery shadows on the ground. He looked at the tracks only occasionally; he knew the way.<br><br> At the glen, he strung his bow with a sure touch, then drew three arrows and nocked one, holding the others in his left hand. The moonlight revealed twenty or so motionless lumps where the deer lay in the grass. The doe he wanted was at the edge of the herd, her left foreleg stretched out awkwardly.<br><br> Eragon slowly crept closer, keeping the bow ready. All his work of the past three days had led to this moment. He took a last steadying breath and&ndash;an explosion shattered the night.<br><br> The herd bolted. Eragon lunged forward, racing through the grass as a fiery wind surged past his cheek. He slid to a stop and loosed an arrow at the bounding doe. It missed by a finger&rsquo;s breadth and hissed into darkness. He cursed and spun around, instinctively nocking another arrow.<br><br> Behind him, where the deer had been, smoldered a large circle of grass and trees. Many of the pines stood bare of their needles. The grass outside the charring was flattened. A wisp of smoke curled in the air, carrying a burnt smell. In the center of the blast radius lay a polished blue stone. Mist snaked across the scorched area and swirled insubstantial tendrils over the stone.<br><br> Eragon watched for danger for several long minutes, but the only thing that moved was the mist. Cautiously, he released the tension from his bow and moved forward. Moonlight cast him in pale<br> shadow as he stopped before the stone. He nudged it with an arrow, then jumped back. Nothing happened, so he warily picked it up.&#160;<br><br> Nature had never polished a stone as smooth as this one. Its flawless surface was dark blue, except for thin veins of white that spiderwebbed across it. The stone was cool and frictionless under his fingers, like hardened silk. Oval and about a foot long, it weighed several pounds, though it felt lighter than it should have.<br><br> Eragon found the stone both beautiful and frightening.&#160;<i>Where did it come from? Does it have a purpose?&#160;</i>Then a more disturbing thought came to him:&#160;<i>Was it sent here by accident, or am I meant to have it?&#160;</i>If he had learned anything from the old stories, it was to treat magic, and those who used it, with great caution.<br><br> <i>But what should I do with the stone?&#160;</i>It would be tiresome to carry, and there was a chance it was dangerous. It might be better to leave it behind. A flicker of indecision ran through him, and he almost dropped it, but something stayed his hand.&#160;<i>At the very least, it might pay for some food,&#160;</i>he decided with a shrug, tucking the stone into his pack.<br><br> The glen was too exposed to make a safe camp, so he slipped back into the forest and spread his bedroll beneath the upturned roots of a fallen tree. After a cold dinner of bread and cheese, he wrapped himself in blankets and fell asleep, pondering what had occurred.",

Could Eragon have prevented his uncle&#8217;s death?<br><br>What was Eragon&#8217;s life like before he found the dragon&#8217;s egg? How did his discovery of the egg change his life? Do you think Eragon found the egg or the egg was deliberately sent to him?<br><br>Why was Eragon comfortable exploring the Spine when everyone else in his village was afraid of the place?

Why does Eragon decide to hear her predictions? <br><br>What does she mean when she says, &#8220;That freedom [to choose your fate] is a gift, but it is also a responsibility more binding than chains&#8221;?<br><br>How does Eragon feel about his fate as a Dragon Rider? What are the benefits of his new life? What are the dangers? Would you choose to take on the responsibilities Eragon has&#8211;caring for Saphira, rescuing Arya, helping the Varden, fighting the Empire?</p><p>3. Trust and Fear<br><br>Why does Brom want to travel with Eragon when he is forced to leave his home? How does Eragon know that he can trust Brom?<br><br>Who are the Ra&#8217;zac and what do they represent to Eragon? <br><br>When Eragon realizes that Arya is an elf, does it change his feelings about her? Why does he rescue her from the prison even though it puts his own rescue in jeopardy?<br><br>How does Eragon feel when he learns about Murtagh&#8217;s parentage? Does the fact that Murtagh&#8217;s father was Morzan affect Eragon&#8217;s trust of him? Does it affect your feelings about his character? <br>When Eragon finds the stronghold of the Varden, he is confronted by the Twins. Why does Ajihad trust the Twins? Why do they treat Eragon with suspicion?</p><p>4. Good and Evil<br><br>Many fantasy novels deal with the struggle between forces of good and evil. Discuss the ways in which Eragon explores this theme and which characters represent good and evil. <br><br>The story begins with the Shade and his ruthless ambush of the elf Arya. How did this Prologue affect your anticipation of the story to come? Why is the Prologue titled &#8220;Shade of Fear&#8221;?<br><br>Are there characters who represent pure good and pure evil? Discuss the ways in which an author shows us a character&#8217;s true nature. How does a character&#8217;s life experience shape his or her actions?<br><br>How did Galbatorix establish his rule of Alaga&#235;sia? What experiences turned him into a cruel and feared ruler? What do we learn of the Shade&#8217;s past when he is killed? <br><br>The Urgals seem to be completely ruthless, yet Eragon is hesitant to kill them with his magic in Chapter 30. Why does he only use his magic to stun them? Why is he so upset when Murtagh kills Torkenbrand, the slave trader?</p><p>5. Connecting Fantasy to Real Life<br><br>What kinds of good and evil do you hear about in the news? Discuss examples from news stories that report events representing the good and evil in our society and around the world.<br><br>What circumstances can bring people together to become friends and what can make those friendships grow and develop? What circumstances can hurt a friendship?<br><br>Do you feel that some people have a destiny to fulfill or a special reason for living? Name people in history who had a strong responsibility to a cause for good or evil. (Possibilities would be Abraham Lincoln, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King for good causes and Adolf Hitler, Attila the Hun, and Josef Stalin for evil.)</p>",

He began   the first draft of the introductory book in the series, <i>Eragon</i>, at age fifteen. Christopher draws inspiration for the world   of Eragon and his dragon, Saphira, from the natural beauty that surrounds his   home in Montana: the tumultuous weather, the roaring Yellowstone River, and   the soaring Beartooth Mountains.

      excerpt:
        "Eragon knelt in a bed of trampled reed grass and scanned the tracks with a practiced eye. The prints told him that the deer had been in the meadow only a half-hour before. Soon they would bed down. His target, a small doe with a pronounced limp in her left forefoot, was still with the herd. He was amazed she had made it so far without a wolf or bear catching her.<br><br> The sky was clear and dark, and a slight breeze stirred the air. A silvery cloud drifted over the mountains that surrounded him, its edges glowing with ruddy light cast from the harvest moon cradled between two peaks. Streams flowed down the mountains from stolid glaciers and glistening snowpacks. A brooding mist crept along the valley&rsquo;s floor, almost thick enough to obscure his feet.&#160;<br><br> Eragon was fifteen, less than a year from manhood. Dark eyebrows rested above his intense brown eyes. His clothes were worn from work. A hunting knife with a bone handle was sheathed at his belt, and a buckskin tube protected his yew bow from the mist. He carried a wood-frame pack.<br><br> The deer had led him deep into the Spine, a range of untamed mountains that extended up and down the land of Alaga&euml;sia. Strange tales and men often came from those mountains, usually boding ill. Despite that, Eragon did not fear the Spine&ndash;he was the only hunter near Carvahall who dared track game deep into its craggy recesses.&#160;<br><br> It was the third night of the hunt, and his food was half gone. If he did not fell the doe, he would be forced to return home empty- handed. His family needed the meat for the rapidly approaching winter and could not afford to buy it in Carvahall.<br><br> Eragon stood with quiet assurance in the dusky moonlight, then strode into the forest toward a glen where he was sure the deer would rest. The trees blocked the sky from view and cast feathery shadows on the ground. He looked at the tracks only occasionally; he knew the way.<br><br> At the glen, he strung his bow with a sure touch, then drew three arrows and nocked one, holding the others in his left hand. The moonlight revealed twenty or so motionless lumps where the deer lay in the grass. The doe he wanted was at the edge of the herd, her left foreleg stretched out awkwardly.<br><br> Eragon slowly crept closer, keeping the bow ready. All his work of the past three days had led to this moment. He took a last steadying breath and&ndash;an explosion shattered the night.<br><br> The herd bolted. Eragon lunged forward, racing through the grass as a fiery wind surged past his cheek. He slid to a stop and loosed an arrow at the bounding doe. It missed by a finger&rsquo;s breadth and hissed into darkness. He cursed and spun around, instinctively nocking another arrow.<br><br> Behind him, where the deer had been, smoldered a large circle of grass and trees. Many of the pines stood bare of their needles. The grass outside the charring was flattened. A wisp of smoke curled in the air, carrying a burnt smell. In the center of the blast radius lay a polished blue stone. Mist snaked across the scorched area and swirled insubstantial tendrils over the stone.<br><br> Eragon watched for danger for several long minutes, but the only thing that moved was the mist. Cautiously, he released the tension from his bow and moved forward. Moonlight cast him in pale<br> shadow as he stopped before the stone. He nudged it with an arrow, then jumped back. Nothing happened, so he warily picked it up.&#160;<br><br> Nature had never polished a stone as smooth as this one. Its flawless surface was dark blue, except for thin veins of white that spiderwebbed across it. The stone was cool and frictionless under his fingers, like hardened silk. Oval and about a foot long, it weighed several pounds, though it felt lighter than it should have.<br><br> Eragon found the stone both beautiful and frightening.&#160;<i>Where did it come from? Does it have a purpose?&#160;</i>Then a more disturbing thought came to him:&#160;<i>Was it sent here by accident, or am I meant to have it?&#160;</i>If he had learned anything from the old stories, it was to treat magic, and those who used it, with great caution.<br><br> <i>But what should I do with the stone?&#160;</i>It would be tiresome to carry, and there was a chance it was dangerous. It might be better to leave it behind. A flicker of indecision ran through him, and he almost dropped it, but something stayed his hand.&#160;<i>At the very least, it might pay for some food,&#160;</i>he decided with a shrug, tucking the stone into his pack.<br><br> The glen was too exposed to make a safe camp, so he slipped back into the forest and spread his bedroll beneath the upturned roots of a fallen tree. After a cold dinner of bread and cheese, he wrapped himself in blankets and fell asleep, pondering what had occurred.",

      rgabout:
        "<b>Introducing Fantasy<br></b><br>Fantasy is a form of literature that presents psychological realities in an imaginative or fantastical way. Using myth and folklore as a background, modern writers of fantasy set their stories in an imagined world or in a real-life setting where magical events take place. Ask the group to discuss folktales and myths they remember hearing or reading in the past. Who were the characters who fought for good, and who were the evil characters? Ask them to describe to each other scenes they remember from those stories. How was magic used? What emotions did the stories evoke? What do they remember of dragons in those early tales? Make a list of character traits exhibited by heroes and villains from folktales and myths. Which of these traits are most important in real-life situations? <br><br><i>WARNING: This guide includes key plot points from both </i>Eldest<i> and </i>Eragon<i>. Should you wish to avoid spoilers, please read both books before this readers guide!</i>",

        "<b>The Inheritance Books<br></b><br>Eragon&#8217;s quiet life explodes with drama when he accepts the inheritance that is his: to become a dragon rider who can change the course of history in his embattled land of Alaga&#235;sia. Teamed with his telepathic dragon Saphira, trained by the finest men and elves, challenged by great obstacles, Eragon fights for the survival of all that is good and true in his battle with the cruel Empire.<i><br></i>",
      rgdiscussion:
        "<p>1. <b>History and Beliefs<br><br></b>- Compare the different historic traditions of Alaga&#235;sia as they are explained in <i>Eldest</i>. Why do the dwarves, the elves, and the humans all have such different mythologies? What do their stories tell us about each of their races?<br><br>- What does Saphira tell Eragon about the dragons&#8217; beliefs in <i>Eldest</i>? Compare what the dragons believe with what the dwarves and elves do. <br><br>- After reading <i>Eldest</i>, explain the origins of the animosity among the races of dragons, elves, dwarves, and humans. What are the effects of those ancient wars on the present day situation in Alaga&#235;sia? <br><br>- Why are the elves vegetarians? Why does Eragon become a vegetarian after living with them and studying with Oromis in <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- Compare the ways the different races live&#8211;the elves in the forest, the dwarves in their caves, the humans in cities and towns. How does the habitat of each of these peoples affect their way of life and their connection with their environment?</p><p>2. <b>Family and Home<br><br></b>- Discuss who his parents might be. Why is his father&#8217;s identity a mystery, and why did his mother bring him to her brother to raise and then disappear? How does the reader&#8217;s understanding change after reading <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- What was Eragon&#8217;s life like before he found the dragon&#8217;s egg in the Spine in <i>Eragon</i>? How did his discovery of the egg change his life? <br><br>- Why was Eragon comfortable exploring the Spine when everyone else in his village was afraid of the place? What does the Spine represent to the other inhabitants of Carvahall? How does Roran convince them to overcome those fears in <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- Is it hard for Roran to convince the villagers to leave their homes in <i>Eldest</i>? What does he hope to find for them when they do leave? Why do some insist on staying behind?<br><br>- Does Nasuada take control of the Varden because she is Ajihad&#8217;s daughter or because she has special qualities of leadership? Compare Nasuada&#8217;s relationship with her father in <i>Eragon</i> with Arya&#8217;s relationship with Islanzad&#237; in <i>Eldest.</i><br><br>- Why does Hrothgar make Eragon a member of his clan before he leaves Farthen D&#251;r in <i>Eldest</i>? What does this mean to Eragon?<br><br>- What feelings do Eragon and Roran experience when they meet again at the end of <i>Eldest</i>? Why is Roran so angry with Eragon? Can he forgive Eragon for Garrow&#8217;s death?<br><br>- When Murtagh tells Eragon who he really is at the end of <i>Eldest,</i> what effect does it have on him? Do you think what Murtagh tells him is true? What does it mean for Eragon&#8217;s future?<br><br>- In the last chapter of <i>Eldest,</i> Eragon thinks: &#8220;Fathers, mothers, brothers, cousins . . . It all comes down to family.&#8221; What does he mean? Who <i>is</i> Eragon&#8217;s true family? Where has he found his greatest sense of belonging?</p><p>3. <b>Destiny and Responsibility<br><br></b>- The first line of <i>Eragon</i> reads: &#8220;Wind howled through the night, carrying a scent that would change the world.&#8221; What does this opening tell you about the meaning of destiny in the tale? What does the author mean by a &#8220;scent that would change the world&#8221;? <br><br>- Discuss the importance of names in Christopher Paolini&#8217;s novels. How does it affect Eragon to learn that his name was also the name of the first dragon rider? How does he choose Saphira&#8217;s name in the first book? In <i>Eldest,</i> how is Eragon affected by others calling him &#8220;Shadeslayer&#8221;? How has Galbatorix gained control over Murtagh and why is that control so complete? <br><br>- What does Saphira mean in <i>Eragon</i> when she says, &#8220;It is our destiny to attempt the impossible, to accomplish great deeds regardless of fear. It is our responsibility to the future.&#8221; Is this true for everyone? What is the responsibility of each of us to the future?<br><br>- In <i>Eragon, </i>Angela the fortuneteller says, &#8220;To know one&#8217;s fate can be a terrible thing.&#8221; Would you want to know your future if someone could tell you? Why does Eragon decide to hear her predictions? What does she mean when she says, &#8220;That freedom [to choose your fate] is a gift, but it is also a responsibility more binding than chains&#8221;? Which of her predictions (in the chapter titled &#8220;The Witch and the Werecat&#8221;) actually come true as the story continues in <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- How does it affect Roran when people start to call him &#8220;Stronghammer&#8221; in <i>Eldest</i>? Why does Roran take most of the village of Carvahall with him in his quest to rescue Katrina?<br><br>- How does Eragon change in the course of his studies with Oromis in <i>Eldest? </i>Which of his new powers are the result of hard training and which are the result of learning more about the use of magic? Is he, indeed, fulfilling a destiny or responding to his sense of duty and responsibility&#8211;or both?</p><p>4. <b>Trust and Fear<br><br></b>- In <i>Eragon</i>, how does Eragon know that he can trust Brom enough to travel with him? Why does he leave his home and all that is familiar to him?<br><br>- Who are the Ra&#8217;zac and what do they represent to Eragon when he first encounters them in <i>Eragon</i>? Why do the Ra&#8217;zac return to Carvahall in <i>Eldest</i>? Why do they take Katrina away with them? Is it trust or fear that makes the people of Carvahall follow Roran into the wilderness?<br><br>- In the first book, when Eragon realizes that Arya is an elf, does it change his feelings about her? Why does he rescue her from the prison even though it puts his own safety in jeopardy? What is it that keeps Arya from returning Eragon&#8217;s affection in <i>Eldest</i>? <br><br>- When Eragon finds the stronghold of the Varden in the first book he is challenged and his mind probed by the Twins. Why did Ajihad trust the Twins? Are there clues in <i>Eragon</i> to indicate that the Twins were actually working for Galbatorix, as we discover in <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- How does Eragon feel when he learns about Murtagh&#8217;s parentage in <i>Eragon</i>? Does the fact that Murtagh&#8217;s father was Morzan affect Eragon&#8217;s trust of him? Does it affect your feelings about his character? What does Eragon feel when he realizes who he is fighting at the end of <i>Eldest</i>? Will he ever be able to trust Murtagh again?<br><br>- What is Eragon&#8217;s greatest fear? What is Roran&#8217;s greatest fear? Do their fears affect the way they act and interact with others? Discuss their reunion in the last chapter of <i>Eldest</i>. Why does Roran strike Eragon? How do they regain their trust for each other?</p><p>5. <b>Use and Abuse of Power<br><br></b>- In <i>Eldest,</i> Oromis says: &#8220;As Galbatorix has demonstrated, power without moral direction is the most dangerous force in the world.&#8221; What does he mean by this? By the end of <i>Eldest</i> what other characters have &#8220;power without moral direction&#8221;? <br><br>- Discuss the connection of magic to power in this story. Why does Eragon have to learn the use of magic so slowly, first from Brom (in <i>Eragon</i>) and then from Oromis (in <i>Eldest</i>)? Who are the other characters that can use magic and what are the limits on their magical powers? <br><br>- Why does the use of magic drain the energy of the person performing the magic? What are the ways that Eragon learns to control his use of magic and his energy in <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- In <i>Eldest,</i> is Murtagh able to use magic more effectively than Eragon? Why do you think this is so?</p><p>6. <b>Good and Evil<br><br></b>- Many fantasy novels deal with the struggle between forces of good and evil. Discuss the ways in which the Inheritance books<i> </i>explore this theme and which characters represent good and which represent evil. Are there some characters that you are still not sure about by the end of <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br><i>- Eragon</i> begins with the Shade and his ruthless ambush of the elf we later learn is Arya. How did this Prologue affect your anticipation of the story to come? Why is the Prologue titled &#8220;Shade of Fear&#8221;? What do we learn of the Shade&#8217;s past when he is killed at the end of <i>Eragon</i>? <br><br>- How did Galbatorix establish his rule of Alaga&#235;sia? According to the history Brom shares in <i>Eragon</i>, what experiences turned Galbatorix into a cruel and feared ruler? <br><br>- The Urgals seem to be completely ruthless, yet Eragon is hesitant to kill them with his magic in <i>Eragon</i>. In the chapter called &#8220;A Costly Mistake,&#8221; why does he only use his magic to stun them? Why is he so upset when Murtagh kills Torkenbrand, the slave trader? By the end of <i>Eldest</i>, Eragon has different feelings about the Urgals. What has changed his mind?<br><br>- In <i>Eldest</i> Roran commits crimes in his efforts to save the people of Carvahall who have placed their trust in him; he kills, steals, and uses trickery to get what he needs. Can he justify what he has done in the name of helping others? How does he feel about the men he has killed?<br><br>- Why is Oromis so angry about the blessing that Eragon gave to the child in Farthen D&#251;r? What is the place of Elva in the story by the end of <i>Eldest</i>? Is her blessing/curse a force for good or for evil? How can it work both ways?</p><p>7. <b>Character Study<br><br></b>- Compare Eragon and his cousin Roran. How do Eragon&#8217;s and Roran&#8217;s journeys in <i>Eldest </i>parallel each other and how are they different? Describe the changes in each of them from the beginning of <i>Eragon</i> to the end of <i>Eldest</i>. What influences are most important on their growth? Which people and events are most important to their development?<br><br>- Compare Brom (in <i>Eragon</i>) and Oromis (in <i>Eldest</i>). How are they similar and how are they different? What does each of them contribute to Eragon&#8217;s training? Which of them, do you think, has the most influence on Eragon&#8217;s growth as a Rider?<br><br>- How would you describe Arya? Why does Arya reject Eragon&#8217;s romantic feelings in <i>Eldest</i>? What aspects of her personality contribute to their friendship and what keeps them from having a romantic relationship? How does Arya feel about being the daughter of the queen?<br><br>- Compare the magical qualities of Angela and Elva as we see them in <i>Eldest. </i>What do we know about each of them and how do their magical abilities contribute to the story? How do you feel about these characters&#8211;in terms of their trustworthiness? <br><br>- Compare the leadership styles of Nasuada and Orrin, the king of Surda, in <i>Eldest. </i>Why do the Varden go to Surda, and what help do they expect from Orrin? <br><br>- Describe the character of Saphira. How has she grown from the time she was a hatchling? What does she learn from Glaedr and how does she grow during her training? What are some of the difficult feelings and pain that Saphira and Eragon share? What are some of the joys that they share?</p><p>8. <b>One Step Beyond: Predictions<br><br>- </b>Do you think Eragon will ever be able to return to the Palancar Valley and Carvahall? He longs for his home in the midst of his adventures, but will he and Roran be able to return to the farm when their adventures are over? <br><br>- At the end of the first book, Eragon hears a voice in his head, someone helping him to escape the horrors of Durza&#8217;s memories. In <i>Eldest,</i> we learn that person is Oromis, who will become Eragon&#8217;s trainer. What foreshadowing comes at the end of <i>Eldest</i>? Predict some of the plot of Book Three of Inheritance. What do you expect to happen?<br><br>- Who are the characters that might play a major role in the next book? Will Eragon come face-to-face with Galbatorix? Will he fight Murtagh again? Will Eragon and Roran be able to rescue Katrina? Who will provide the most assistance to Eragon?<br><br>- Why do you think Galbaltorix continues to gain strength, and how is he able to make Murtagh stronger than Eragon? How do you think Eragon and Saphira can develop the strength to combat the evil powers of Galbatorix?</p><p>9. <b>Connecting Fantasy to Real Life<br></b><br>- What kinds of good and evil do you hear about in the news of our world? Discuss examples from news stories that report events representing the good and evil in our society and in international news.<br><br>- What circumstances can bring people together to become friends and what can make those friendships grow and develop? What circumstances can hurt a friendship? What are some of the ways people have difficulty with family members?<br><br>- Do you feel that some people have a destiny to fulfill or a special reason for living? Name people in history who had a strong responsibility to a cause for good or evil. (Possibilities might be Abraham Lincoln, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King for good causes and Attila the Hun, Adolf Hitler, and Josef Stalin for evil.) <br><br>- Name some characters from legend, literature, or film who represent the causes of good or evil. (Possibilities might be Luke Skywalker, King Arthur, Frodo for good; Darth Vader, Mordred, Sauron for evil.)<br><br><br><br>Guide prepared by Connie Rockman, Children&#8217;s Literature Consultant, adjunct professor of literature for youth, and editor of the <i>Junior Authors and Illustrators</i> series (H.W.

      excerpt:
        "The Council of Elders<br>Saphira's breathing quickened, and she opened her eyes, yawning expansively. <i>Good morning, little one.</i> <br><i>Is it? </i>He looked down and leaned on his hands, compressing the mattress. <i>It's terrible . . . Murtagh and Ajihad . . . Why didn't sentries in the tunnels warn us of the Urgals? They shouldn't have been able to trail Ajihad's group without being noticed. . . . Arya was right, it doesn't make sense.</i> <br><i>We may never know the truth</i>, said Saphira gently. She stood, wings brushing the ceiling. <i>You need to eat, then we must discover what the Varden are planning. We can't waste time; a new leader could be chosen within hours. </i><br>Eragon agreed, thinking of how they had left everyone yesterday: Orik rushing off to give King Hrothgar the tidings, J&#246;rmundur taking Ajihad's body to a place where it would rest until the funeral, and Arya, who stood alone and watched the goings-on. <br>Eragon rose and strapped on Zar'roc and his bow, then bent and lifted Snowfire's saddle. A line of pain sheared through his torso, driving him to the floor, where he writhed, scrabbling at his back. It felt like he was being sawed in half. Saphira growled as the ripping sensation reached her. She tried to soothe him with her own mind but was unable to alleviate his suffering. Her tail instinctually lifted, as if to fight. <br>It took minutes before the fit subsided and the last throb faded away, leaving Eragon gasping. Sweat drenched his face, making his hair stick and his eyes sting. He reached back and gingerly fingered the top of his scar. It was hot and inflamed and sensitive to touch. Saphira lowered her nose and touched him on the arm. <i>Oh, little one. . . . </i><br>It was worse this time, he said, staggering upright. She let him lean against her as he wiped away the sweat with a rag, then he tentatively stepped for the door. <br><i>Are you strong enough to go?</i><br><i>We have to. We're obliged as dragon and Rider to make a public choice regarding the next head of the Varden, and perhaps even influence the selection. I won't ignore the strength of our position; we now wield great authority written the Varden. At least the Twins aren't here to grab the position for themselves. That's the only good in the situation. </i><br><i>Very well, but Durza should suffer a thousand years of torture for what he did to you. </i><br>He grunted. <i>Just stay close to me.</i> <br>Together they made their way through Tronjheim, toward the nearest kitchen. In the corridors and hallways, people stopped and bowed to them, murmuring, &quot;Argetlam,&quot; or &quot;Shadeslayer.&quot; Even dwarves made the motions, though not as often. Eragon was struck by the somber, haunted expressions of the humans and the dark clothing they wore to display their sadness. Many women dressed entirely in black, lace veils covering their faces. <br>In the kitchen, Eragon brought a stone platter of food to a low table. Saphira watched him carefully in case he should have another attack. Several people tried to approach him, but she lifted a lip and growled sending them scurrying away. Eragon pretended to ignore the disturbances and picked at the food. Finally, trying to divert his thoughts from Murtagh, he asked, <i>Who do you think has the means to take control of the Varden, now that Ajihad and the Twins are gone? </i><br><i>She hesitated. It's possible you could, if Ajihad's last words were interpreted as a blessing to secure the leadership. Almost no one would oppose you. However, that does not seem a wise path to take. I see only trouble in that direction.</i> <br><i>I agree. Besides, Arya wouldn't approve, and she could be a dangerous enemy. Elves can't lie in the ancient language, but they have no such inhibition in ours-she could deny that Ajihad ever uttered those words if it served her purposes. No, I don't want the position. . . . What about J&#246;rmundur? </i><br><i>Ajihad called him his right-hand man. Unfortunately, we know little about him or the Varden's other leaders. Such a short time has passed since we came here. We will have to make our judgment on our feelings and impressions, without the benefit of history. </i><br>Eragon pushed his fish around a lump of mashed tubers. <i>Don't forget Hrothgar and the dwarf clans; they won't be quiet in this. Except for Arya, the elves have no say in the succession-a decision will be made before word of this even reaches them. But the dwarves can't be-won't be-ignored. Hrothgar favors the Varden, but if enough clans oppose him, he might be maneuvered into backing someone unsuited for the command.</i> <br><i>And who might that be? </i><br><i>A person easily manipulated. </i>He closed his eyes and leaned back. <i>It could be anyone in Farthen D&#251;r, anyone at all.</i>",

        "<b>Introducing Fantasy<br></b><br>Fantasy is a form of literature that presents psychological realities in an imaginative or fantastical way. Using myth and folklore as a background, modern writers of fantasy set their stories in an imagined world or in a real-life setting where magical events take place. Ask the group to discuss folktales and myths they remember hearing or reading in the past. Who were the characters who fought for good, and who were the evil characters? Ask them to describe to each other scenes they remember from those stories. How was magic used? What emotions did the stories evoke? What do they remember of dragons in those early tales? Make a list of character traits exhibited by heroes and villains from folktales and myths. Which of these traits are most important in real-life situations? <br><br><i>WARNING: This guide includes key plot points from both </i>Eldest<i> and </i>Eragon<i>.

        "<b>The Inheritance Books<br></b><br>Eragon&#8217;s quiet life explodes with drama when he accepts the inheritance that is his: to become a dragon rider who can change the course of history in his embattled land of Alaga&#235;sia. Teamed with his telepathic dragon Saphira, trained by the finest men and elves, challenged by great obstacles, Eragon fights for the survival of all that is good and true in his battle with the cruel Empire<br><b><br></b>",
      rgdiscussion:
        "<p>1. <b>History and Beliefs<br><br></b>- Compare the different historic traditions of Alaga&#235;sia as they are explained in <i>Eldest</i>. Why do the dwarves, the elves, and the humans all have such different mythologies?

Why does Eragon become a vegetarian after living with them and studying with Oromis in <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- Compare the ways the different races live&#8211;the elves in the forest, the dwarves in their caves, the humans in cities and towns. How does the habitat of each of these peoples affect their way of life and their connection with their environment?</p><p>2. <b>Family and Home<br><br></b>- Discuss who his parents might be. Why is his father&#8217;s identity a mystery, and why did his mother bring him to her brother to raise and then disappear? How does the reader&#8217;s understanding change after reading <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- What was Eragon&#8217;s life like before he found the dragon&#8217;s egg in the Spine in <i>Eragon</i>? How did his discovery of the egg change his life? <br><br>- Why was Eragon comfortable exploring the Spine when everyone else in his village was afraid of the place? What does the Spine represent to the other inhabitants of Carvahall? How does Roran convince them to overcome those fears in <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- Is it hard for Roran to convince the villagers to leave their homes in <i>Eldest</i>? What does he hope to find for them when they do leave? Why do some insist on staying behind?<br><br>- Does Nasuada take control of the Varden because she is Ajihad&#8217;s daughter or because she has special qualities of leadership? Compare Nasuada&#8217;s relationship with her father in <i>Eragon</i> with Arya&#8217;s relationship with Islanzad&#237; in <i>Eldest.</i><br><br>- Why does Hrothgar make Eragon a member of his clan before he leaves Farthen D&#251;r in <i>Eldest</i>? What does this mean to Eragon?<br><br>- What feelings do Eragon and Roran experience when they meet again at the end of <i>Eldest</i>? Why is Roran so angry with Eragon? Can he forgive Eragon for Garrow&#8217;s death?<br><br>- When Murtagh tells Eragon who he really is at the end of <i>Eldest,</i> what effect does it have on him? Do you think what Murtagh tells him is true? What does it mean for Eragon&#8217;s future?<br><br>- In the last chapter of <i>Eldest,</i> Eragon thinks: &#8220;Fathers, mothers, brothers, cousins . . . It all comes down to family.&#8221; What does he mean? Who <i>is</i> Eragon&#8217;s true family? Where has he found his greatest sense of belonging?</p><p>3. <b>Destiny and Responsibility<br><br></b>- The first line of <i>Eragon</i> reads: &#8220;Wind howled through the night, carrying a scent that would change the world.&#8221; What does this opening tell you about the meaning of destiny in the tale? What does the author mean by a &#8220;scent that would change the world&#8221;? <br><br>- Discuss the importance of names in Christopher Paolini&#8217;s novels. How does it affect Eragon to learn that his name was also the name of the first dragon rider? How does he choose Saphira&#8217;s name in the first book? In <i>Eldest,</i> how is Eragon affected by others calling him &#8220;Shadeslayer&#8221;? How has Galbatorix gained control over Murtagh and why is that control so complete? <br><br>- What does Saphira mean in <i>Eragon</i> when she says, &#8220;It is our destiny to attempt the impossible, to accomplish great deeds regardless of fear. It is our responsibility to the future.&#8221; Is this true for everyone? What is the responsibility of each of us to the future?<br><br>- In <i>Eragon, </i>Angela the fortuneteller says, &#8220;To know one&#8217;s fate can be a terrible thing.&#8221; Would you want to know your future if someone could tell you? Why does Eragon decide to hear her predictions? What does she mean when she says, &#8220;That freedom [to choose your fate] is a gift, but it is also a responsibility more binding than chains&#8221;? Which of her predictions (in the chapter titled &#8220;The Witch and the Werecat&#8221;) actually come true as the story continues in <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- How does it affect Roran when people start to call him &#8220;Stronghammer&#8221; in <i>Eldest</i>? Why does Roran take most of the village of Carvahall with him in his quest to rescue Katrina?<br><br>- How does Eragon change in the course of his studies with Oromis in <i>Eldest? </i>Which of his new powers are the result of hard training and which are the result of learning more about the use of magic? Is he, indeed, fulfilling a destiny or responding to his sense of duty and responsibility&#8211;or both?</p><p>4. <b>Trust and Fear<br><br></b>- In <i>Eragon</i>, how does Eragon know that he can trust Brom enough to travel with him? Why does he leave his home and all that is familiar to him?<br><br>- Who are the Ra&#8217;zac and what do they represent to Eragon when he first encounters them in <i>Eragon</i>? Why do the Ra&#8217;zac return to Carvahall in <i>Eldest</i>? Why do they take Katrina away with them? Is it trust or fear that makes the people of Carvahall follow Roran into the wilderness?<br><br>- In the first book, when Eragon realizes that Arya is an elf, does it change his feelings about her? Why does he rescue her from the prison even though it puts his own safety in jeopardy? What is it that keeps Arya from returning Eragon&#8217;s affection in <i>Eldest</i>? <br><br>- When Eragon finds the stronghold of the Varden in the first book he is challenged and his mind probed by the Twins. Why did Ajihad trust the Twins? Are there clues in <i>Eragon</i> to indicate that the Twins were actually working for Galbatorix, as we discover in <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- How does Eragon feel when he learns about Murtagh&#8217;s parentage in <i>Eragon</i>? Does the fact that Murtagh&#8217;s father was Morzan affect Eragon&#8217;s trust of him? Does it affect your feelings about his character? What does Eragon feel when he realizes who he is fighting at the end of <i>Eldest</i>? Will he ever be able to trust Murtagh again?<br><br>- What is Eragon&#8217;s greatest fear? What is Roran&#8217;s greatest fear? Do their fears affect the way they act and interact with others? Discuss their reunion in the last chapter of <i>Eldest</i>. Why does Roran strike Eragon? How do they regain their trust for each other?</p><p>5. <b>Use and Abuse of Power<br><br></b>- In <i>Eldest,</i> Oromis says: &#8220;As Galbatorix has demonstrated, power without moral direction is the most dangerous force in the world.&#8221; What does he mean by this? By the end of <i>Eldest</i> what other characters have &#8220;power without moral direction&#8221;? <br><br>- Discuss the connection of magic to power in this story. Why does Eragon have to learn the use of magic so slowly, first from Brom (in <i>Eragon</i>) and then from Oromis (in <i>Eldest</i>)? Who are the other characters that can use magic and what are the limits on their magical powers? <br><br>- Why does the use of magic drain the energy of the person performing the magic? What are the ways that Eragon learns to control his use of magic and his energy in <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br>- In <i>Eldest,</i> is Murtagh able to use magic more effectively than Eragon? Why do you think this is so?</p><p>6. <b>Good and Evil<br><br></b>- Many fantasy novels deal with the struggle between forces of good and evil. Discuss the ways in which the Inheritance books<i> </i>explore this theme and which characters represent good and which represent evil. Are there some characters that you are still not sure about by the end of <i>Eldest</i>?<br><br><i>- Eragon</i> begins with the Shade and his ruthless ambush of the elf we later learn is Arya. How did this Prologue affect your anticipation of the story to come? Why is the Prologue titled &#8220;Shade of Fear&#8221;? What do we learn of the Shade&#8217;s past when he is killed at the end of <i>Eragon</i>? <br><br>- How did Galbatorix establish his rule of Alaga&#235;sia? According to the history Brom shares in <i>Eragon</i>, what experiences turned Galbatorix into a cruel and feared ruler? <br><br>- The Urgals seem to be completely ruthless, yet Eragon is hesitant to kill them with his magic in <i>Eragon</i>. In the chapter called &#8220;A Costly Mistake,&#8221; why does he only use his magic to stun them? Why is he so upset when Murtagh kills Torkenbrand, the slave trader? By the end of <i>Eldest</i>, Eragon has different feelings about the Urgals. What has changed his mind?<br><br>- In <i>Eldest</i> Roran commits crimes in his efforts to save the people of Carvahall who have placed their trust in him; he kills, steals, and uses trickery to get what he needs. Can he justify what he has done in the name of helping others? How does he feel about the men he has killed?<br><br>- Why is Oromis so angry about the blessing that Eragon gave to the child in Farthen D&#251;r? What is the place of Elva in the story by the end of <i>Eldest</i>? Is her blessing/curse a force for good or for evil? How can it work both ways?</p><p>7. <b>Character Study<br><br></b>- Compare Eragon and his cousin Roran. How do Eragon&#8217;s and Roran&#8217;s journeys in <i>Eldest </i>parallel each other and how are they different? Describe the changes in each of them from the beginning of <i>Eragon</i> to the end of <i>Eldest</i>. What influences are most important on their growth? Which people and events are most important to their development?<br><br>- Compare Brom (in <i>Eragon</i>) and Oromis (in <i>Eldest</i>). How are they similar and how are they different? What does each of them contribute to Eragon&#8217;s training? Which of them, do you think, has the most influence on Eragon&#8217;s growth as a Rider?<br><br>- How would you describe Arya? Why does Arya reject Eragon&#8217;s romantic feelings in <i>Eldest</i>? What aspects of her personality contribute to their friendship and what keeps them from having a romantic relationship? How does Arya feel about being the daughter of the queen?<br><br>- Compare the magical qualities of Angela and Elva as we see them in <i>Eldest. </i>What do we know about each of them and how do their magical abilities contribute to the story? How do you feel about these characters&#8211;in terms of their trustworthiness? <br><br>- Compare the leadership styles of Nasuada and Orrin, the king of Surda, in <i>Eldest. </i>Why do the Varden go to Surda, and what help do they expect from Orrin? <br><br>- Describe the character of Saphira. How has she grown from the time she was a hatchling? What does she learn from Glaedr and how does she grow during her training?

He longs for his home in the midst of his adventures, but will he and Roran be able to return to the farm when their adventures are over? <br><br>- At the end of the first book, Eragon hears a voice in his head, someone helping him to escape the horrors of Durza&#8217;s memories. In <i>Eldest,</i> we learn that person is Oromis, who will become Eragon&#8217;s trainer. What foreshadowing comes at the end of <i>Eldest</i>? Predict some of the plot of Book Three of Inheritance. What do you expect to happen?<br><br>- Who are the characters that might play a major role in the next book? Will Eragon come face-to-face with Galbatorix? Will he fight Murtagh again? Will Eragon and Roran be able to rescue Katrina? Who will provide the most assistance to Eragon?<br><br>- Why do you think Galbaltorix continues to gain strength, and how is he able to make Murtagh stronger than Eragon?

      excerpt:
        '<p>Eragon stared at the dark tower of stone wherein hid the monsters who had murdered his uncle, Garrow.&#160;&#160;&#160;<br> He was lying on his belly behind the edge of a sandy hill dotted with sparse blades of grass, thornbushes, and small, rosebud-like cactuses. The brittle stems of last year\'s foliage pricked his palms as he inched forward to gain a better view of Helgrind, which loomed over the surrounding land like a black dagger thrust out from the bowels of the earth.<br> The evening sun streaked the low hills with shadows long and narrow and--far in the west--illuminated the surface of Leona Lake so that the horizon became a rippling bar of gold.<br> To his left, Eragon heard the steady breathing of his cousin, Roran, who was stretched out beside him. The normally inaudible flow of air seemed preternaturally loud to Eragon with his heightened sense of hearing, one of many such changes wrought by his experience during the Agaet&rsquo;&#160;Bladhren, the elves\' Blood-oath Celebration.<br> He paid little attention to that now as he watched a column of people inch toward the base of Helgrind, apparently having walked from the city of Dras-Leona, some miles away. A contingent of twenty-four men and women, garbed in thick leather robes, occupied the head of the column. This group moved with many strange and varied gaits--they limped and shuffled and humped and wriggled; they swung on crutches or used arms to propel themselves forward on curiously short legs--contortions that were necessary because, as Eragon realized, every one of the twenty-_four lacked an arm or a leg or some combination thereof. Their leader sat upright upon a litter borne by six oiled slaves, a pose Eragon regarded as a rather amazing accomplishment, considering that the man or woman--he could not tell which--consisted of nothing more than a torso and head, upon whose brow balanced an ornate leather crest three feet high.<br> "The priests of Helgrind," he murmured to Roran.<br> "Can they use magic?"<br> "Possibly. I dare not explore Helgrind with my mind until they leave, for if any are magicians, they will sense my touch, however light, and our presence will be revealed."<br> Behind the priests trudged a double line of young men swathed in gold cloth. Each carried a rectangular metal frame subdivided by&#160;twelve horizontal crossbars from which hung iron bells the size of winter rutabagas. Half of the young men gave their frames a vigorous shake when they stepped forward with their right foot, producing a dolorous cacophony of notes, while the other half shook their frames when they advanced upon the left foot, causing iron tongues to crash against iron throats and emit a mournful clamor that echoed over the hills. The acolytes accompanied the throbbing of the bells with their own cries, groaning and shouting&#160;in an ecstasy of passion.<br> At the rear of the grotesque procession trudged a comet\'s tail of inhabitants from Dras-Leona: nobles, merchants, tradesmen, several high-ranking military commanders, and a motley collection of those less fortunate, such as laborers, beggars, and common foot soldiers.<br> Eragon wondered if Dras-Leona\'s governor, Marcus Tabor, was somewhere in their midst.<br> Drawing to a stop at the edge of the precipitous mound of scree that ringed Helgrind, the priests gathered on either side of a&#160;rust-colored boulder with a polished top. When the entire column stood motionless before the crude altar, the creature upon the litter stirred and began to chant in a voice as discordant as the moaning of the bells. The shaman\'s declamations were repeatedly truncated by gusts of wind, but Eragon caught snatches of the ancient language--strangely twisted and mispronounced--interspersed with dwarf and Urgal words, all of which were united by an archaic dialect of Eragon\'s own tongue. What he understood caused&#160;him to shudder, for the sermon spoke of things best left unknown, of a malevolent hate that had festered for centuries in the dark caverns of people\'s hearts before being allowed to flourish in the Riders\' absence, of blood and madness, and of foul rituals performed underneath a black moon.<br> At the end of that depraved oration, two of the lesser priests rushed forward and lifted their master--or mistress, as the case might be--off the litter and onto the face of the altar. Then the High Priest issued a brief order. Twin blades of steel winked like stars as they rose and fell. A rivulet of blood sprang from each of the High Priest\'s shoulders, flowed down the leather-encased torso, and then pooled across the boulder until it overflowed onto the gravel below.<br> Two more priests jumped forward to catch the crimson flow in goblets that, when filled to the rim, were distributed among the members of the congregation, who eagerly drank.<br> "Gar!" said Roran in an undertone. "You failed to mention that those errant flesh-mongers, those gore-bellied, boggle-minded idiot-worshipers were cannibals."<br> "Not quite. They do not partake of the meat."<br> When all the attendees had wet their throats, the servile novitiates returned the High Priest to the litter and bound the creature\'s shoulders with strips of white linen. Wet blotches quickly sullied the virgin cloth.<br> The wounds seemed to have no effect upon the High Priest, for the limbless figure rotated back toward the devotees with their lips of cranberry red and pronounced, "Now are you truly my Brothers and Sisters, having tasted the sap of my veins here in the shadow of almighty Helgrind. Blood calls to blood, and if ever your Family should need help, do then what you can for the Church and for others who acknowledge the power of our Dread Lord._._._._To affirm and reaffirm our fealty to the Triumvirate, recite with me the Nine Oaths._._._._By Gorm, Ilda, and Fell Angvara, we vow to perform homage at least thrice a month, in the hour before dusk, and then to make an offering&#160;of ourselves to appease the eternal hunger of our Great and Terrible Lord._._._._We vow to observe the strictures as they are presented in the book of Tosk._._._._We vow to always carry our Bregnir on our bodies and to forever abstain from the twelve of twelves and the touch of a&#160; many-knotted rope, lest it corrupt_._._."<br> &#160;<br><br></p>',

      excerpt:
        "ASSAULT ON HELGRIND&#160;<br><br> Daybreak was &#64257;fteen minutes away when Eragon rolled up right. He snapped his &#64257;ngers twice to wake Roran and then scooped up his blankets and knotted them into a tight bundle. Pushing himself off the ground, Roran did likewise with his own&#160;<br> bedding. They looked at each other and shivered with excitement. &ldquo;If I die,&rdquo; said Roran, &ldquo;you will see to Katrina?&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;I shall.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;Tell her then that I went into battle with joy in my heart and her&#160;name upon my lips.&rdquo;<br><br> &ldquo;I shall.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> Eragon muttered a quick line in the ancient language. The drop in his strength that followed was almost imperceptible. &ldquo;There. That will &#64257;lter the air in front of us and protect us from the paralyz ing effects of the Ra&rsquo;zac&rsquo;s breath.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> From his bags, Eragon removed his shirt of mail and unwrapped the length of sackcloth he had stored it in. Blood from the &#64257;ght on the Burning Plains still encrusted the once-shining corselet, and the combination of dried gore, sweat, and neglect had allowed blotches of rust to creep across the rings. The mail was, however, free of tears, as Eragon had repaired them before they had departed for the Empire.&#160;<br><br> Eragon donned the leather-backed shirt, wrinkling his nose at the stench of death and desperation that clung to it, then attached chased bracers to his forearms and greaves to his shins. Upon his head he placed a padded arming cap, a mail coif, and a plain steel helm. He had lost his own helm&mdash;the one he had worn in Farthen D&ucirc;r and that the dwarves had engraved with the crest of D&ucirc;rgrimst Ingeitum&mdash;along with his shield during the aerial duel between Saphira and Thorn. On his hands went mailed gauntlets.&#160;<br><br> Roran out&#64257;tted himself in a similar manner, although he augmented his armor with a wooden shield. A band of soft iron wrapped around the lip of the shield, the better to catch and hold an enemy&rsquo;s sword. No shield encumbered Eragon&rsquo;s left arm; the hawthorn staff required two hands to wield properly.&#160;<br><br> Across his back, Eragon slung the quiver given to him by Queen Islanzad&iacute;. In addition to twenty heavy oak arrows &#64258;etched with gray goose feathers, the quiver contained the bow with silver &#64257;ttings that the queen had sung out of a yew tree for him. The bow was already strung and ready for use.&#160;<br><br> Saphira kneaded the soil beneath her feet.&#160;<i>Let us be off!&#160;</i><br><br> <br> Leaving their bags and supplies hanging from the branch of a juniper tree, Eragon and Roran clambered onto Saphira&rsquo;s back. They wasted no time saddling her; she had worn her tack through the&#160;night. The molded leather was warm, almost hot, underneath Eragon. He clutched the neck spike in front of him&mdash;to steady himself during sudden changes in direction&mdash;while Roran hooked one thick arm around Eragon&rsquo;s waist and brandished his hammer with the other.&#160;<br><br> A piece of shale cracked under Saphira&rsquo;s weight as she settled into a low crouch and, in a single giddy bound, leaped up to the rim of the gulch, where she balanced for a moment before unfolding her massive wings. The thin membranes thrummed as Saphira raised them toward the sky. Vertical, they looked like two translucent blue sails.&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;Not so tight,&rdquo; grunted Eragon.&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said Roran. He loosened his embrace.&#160;<br><br> Further speech became impossible as Saphira jumped again. When she reached the pinnacle, she brought her wings down with a mighty&#160;<i>whoosh,&#160;</i>driving the three of them even higher. With each subsequent &#64258;ap, they climbed closer to the &#64258;at, narrow clouds.&#160;<br><br> As Saphira angled toward Helgrind, Eragon glanced to his left and discovered that he could see a broad swath of Leona  Lake some miles distant. A thick layer of mist, gray and ghostly in the predawn glow, emanated from the water, as if witch&#64257;re burned upon the sur face of the liquid. Eragon tried, but even with his hawklike vision, he could not make out the far shore, nor the southern reaches of the Spine beyond, which he regretted. It had been too long since he had laid eyes upon the mountain range of his childhood.&#160;<br><br> To the north stood&#160; Dras-Leona, a huge, rambling mass that ap peared as a blocky silhouette against the wall of mist that edged its western &#64258;ank. The one building Eragon could identify was the cathedral where the Ra&rsquo;zac had attacked him; its &#64258;anged spire loomed above the rest of the city, like a barbed spearhead.&#160;<br><br> And somewhere in the landscape that rushed past below, Eragon knew, were the remnants of the campsite where the Ra&rsquo;zac had mortally wounded Brom. He allowed all of his anger and grief over the events of that day&mdash;as well as Garrow&rsquo;s murder and the destruction of their farm&mdash;to surge forth and give him the courage, nay, the&#160;<i>desire,&#160;</i>to face the Ra&rsquo;zac in combat.&#160;<i>Eragon,&#160;</i>said Saphira.&#160;<i>Today we need not guard our minds and keep&#160;our thoughts secret from one another, do we? Not unless another magician should appear.&#160;</i><br><br> A fan of golden light &#64258;ared into existence as the top of the sun crested the horizon. In an instant, the full spectrum of colors en livened the previously drab world: the mist glowed white, the water became a rich blue, the daubed-mud wall that encircled the center of Dras-Leona revealed its dingy yellow sides, the trees cloaked themselves in every shade of green, and the soil blushed red and or ange. Helgrind, however, remained as it always was&mdash;black.&#160;<br><br> The mountain of stone rapidly grew larger as they approached.&#160;<br><br> Even from the air, it was intimidating. Diving toward the base of Helgrind, Saphira tilted so far to her&#160;left, Eragon and Roran would have fallen if they had not already strapped their legs to the saddle. Then she whipped around the apron of scree and over the altar where the priests of Helgrind observed their ceremonies. The lip of Eragon&rsquo;s helm caught the wind from her passage and produced a howl that almost deafened him.&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; shouted Roran. He could not see in front of them.&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;The slaves are gone!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> A great weight seemed to press Eragon into his seat as Saphira pulled out of her dive and spiraled up around Helgrind, searching for an entrance to the Ra&rsquo;zac&rsquo;s hideout.&#160;<br> <i>Not even a hole big enough for a woodrat,&#160;</i>she declared. She slowed and hung in place before a ridge that connected the third lowest of the four peaks to the prominence above. The jagged buttress magni &#64257;ed the boom produced by each stroke of her wings until it was as loud as a thunderclap. Eragon&rsquo;s eyes watered as the air pulsed against his skin.&#160;<br><br> A web of white veins adorned the backside of the crags and pillars, where hoarfrost had collected in the cracks that furrowed the rock. Nothing else disturbed the gloom of Helgrind&rsquo;s inky, windswept ramparts. No trees grew among the slanting stones, nor shrubs, grass, or lichen, nor did eagles dare nest upon the tower&rsquo;s broken ledges. True to its name, Helgrind was a place of death, and stood cloaked in the&#160; razor-sharp,&#160; sawtooth folds of its scarps and clefts like a bony specter risen to haunt the earth.&#160;<br><br> Casting his mind outward, Eragon con&#64257;rmed the presence of the two people whom he had discovered imprisoned within Helgrind the previous day, but he felt nothing of the slaves, and to his concern, he still could not locate the Ra&rsquo;zac or the Lethrblaka.&#160;<i>If they aren&rsquo;t here, then where?&#160;</i>he wondered. Searching again, he noticed something that had eluded him before: a single &#64258;ower, a gentian, blooming not &#64257;fty feet in front of them, where, by all rights, there ought to be solid rock.&#160;<i>How does it get enough light to live?&#160;</i><br><br> Saphira answered his question by perching on a crumbling spur several feet to the right. As she did, she lost her balance for a moment and &#64258;ared her wings to steady herself. Instead of brushing against the bulk of Helgrind, the tip of her right wing dipped into the rock and then back out again.&#160;<br><br> <i>Saphira, did you see that!&#160;</i><br><br> <i>I did.&#160;</i><br><br> Leaning forward, Saphira pushed the tip of her snout toward the sheer rock, paused an inch or two away&mdash;as if waiting for a trap to spring&mdash;then continued her advance. Scale by scale, Saphira&rsquo;s head slid into Helgrind, until all that was visible of her to Eragon was a neck, torso, and wings.&#160;<br><br> <i>It&rsquo;s an illusion!&#160;</i>exclaimed Saphira.&#160;<br><br> With a surge of her mighty thews, she abandoned the spur and &#64258;ung the rest of her body after her head. It required every bit of Eragon&rsquo;s self- control not to cover his face in a desperate bid to pro tect himself as the crag rushed toward him.&#160;<br><br> An instant later, he found himself looking at a broad, vaulted cave suffused with the warm glow of morning. Saphira&rsquo;s scales refracted the light, casting thousands of shifting blue &#64258;ecks across the rock. Twisting around, Eragon saw no wall behind them, only the mouth of the cave and a sweeping view of the landscape beyond.&#160;<br> Eragon grimaced. It had never occurred to him that Galbatorix might have hidden the Ra&rsquo;zac&rsquo;s lair with magic.&#160;<i>Idiot! I have to do better,&#160;</i>he thought. Underestimating the king was a sure way to get them all killed.&#160;<br><br> Roran swore and said, &ldquo;Warn me before you do something like&#160;that again.&rdquo; Hunching forward, Eragon began to unbuckle his legs from the&#160;saddle as he studied their surroundings, alert for danger.&#160;<br><br> The opening to the cave was an irregular oval, perhaps &#64257;fty feet high and sixty feet wide. From there the chamber expanded to twice that size before ending a good bowshot away in a pile of thick stone slabs that leaned against each other in a confusion of uncertain angles. A mat of scratches defaced the &#64258;oor, evidence of the many times the Lethrblaka had taken off from, landed on, and walked about its surface. Like mysterious keyholes, &#64257;ve low tunnels pierced the sides of the cave, as did a lancet passageway large enough to accommodate Saphira. Eragon examined the tunnels carefully, but they were&#160; pitch-black and appeared vacant, a fact he con&#64257;rmed with quick thrusts of his mind. Strange, disjointed murmurs echoed from within Hel&shy;grind&rsquo;s innards, suggesting unknown&#160;<i>things&#160;</i>scurrying about in the dark, and endlessly dripping water. Adding to the chorus of whispers was the steady rise and fall of Saphira&rsquo;s breathing, which was over loud in the con&#64257;nes of the bare chamber.&#160;<br><br> The most distinctive feature of the cavern, however, was the mixture of odors that pervaded it. The smell of cold stone domi nated, but underneath Eragon discerned whiffs of damp and mold and something far worse: the sickly sweet fetor of rotting meat.&#160;<br><br> Undoing the last few straps, Eragon swung his right leg over Saphira&rsquo;s spine, so he was sitting sidesaddle, and prepared to jump off her back. Roran did the same on the opposite side.&#160;<br><br> Before he released his hold, Eragon heard, amid the many rustlings that teased his ear, a score of simultaneous clicks, as if someone had struck the rock with a collection of hammers. The sound repeated itself a half second later.&#160;<br><br> He looked in the direction of the noise, as did Saphira.&#160;<br><br> A huge, twisted shape hurtled out of the lancet passageway. Eyes black, bulging, rimless. A beak seven feet long. Batlike wings. The torso naked, hairless, rippling with muscle. Claws like iron spikes.&#160;<br><br> Saphira lurched as she tried to evade the Lethrblaka, but to no avail. The creature crashed into her right side with what felt to Eragon like the strength and fury of an avalanche.&#160;<br><br> What exactly happened next, he knew not, for the impact sent him tumbling through space without so much as a half-formed thought in his jumbled brain. His blind &#64258;ight ended as abruptly as it began when something hard and &#64258;at rammed against the back of him, and he dropped to the &#64258;oor, banging his head a second time.&#160;<br><br> That last collision drove the remaining air clean out of Eragon&rsquo;s&#160;lungs. Stunned, he lay curled on his side, gasping and struggling to&#160;regain a semblance of control over his unresponsive limbs.&#160;<br><br> <i>Eragon!&#160;</i>cried Saphira.&#160;<br><br> The concern in her voice fueled Eragon&rsquo;s efforts as nothing else could. As life returned to his arms and legs, he reached out and grasped his staff from where it had fallen beside him. He planted the spike mounted on the staff&rsquo;s lower end into a nearby crack and pulled himself up the hawthorn rod and onto his feet. He swayed. A swarm of crimson sparks danced before him.&#160;<br><br> The situation was so confusing, he hardly knew where to look &#64257;rst.&#160;<br><br> Saphira and the Lethrblaka rolled across the cave, kicking and clawing and snapping at each other with enough force to gouge the rock beneath them. The clamor of their &#64257;ght must have been unimaginably loud, but to Eragon they grappled in silence; his ears did not work. Still, he felt the vibrations through the soles of his feet as the colossal beasts thrashed from side to side, threatening to crush anyone who came near them.&#160;<br><br> A torrent of blue &#64257;re erupted from between Saphira&rsquo;s jaws and bathed the left side of the Lethrblaka&rsquo;s head in a ravening inferno hot enough to melt steel. The &#64258;ames curved around the Lethrblaka without harming it. Undeterred, the monster pecked at Saphira&rsquo;s neck, forcing her to stop and defend herself.&#160;<br><br> Fast as an arrow loosed from a bow, the second Lethrblaka darted out of the lancet passageway, pounced upon Saphira&rsquo;s &#64258;ank, and, opening its narrow beak, uttered a horrible, withering shriek that made Eragon&rsquo;s scalp prickle and a cold lump of dread form in his gut. He snarled in discomfort;&#160;<i>that&#160;</i>he could hear.&#160;<br><br> The smell now, with both Lethrblaka present, resembled the sort of overpowering stench one would get from tossing a half- dozen pounds of rancid meat into a barrel of sewage and allowing the mix ture to ferment for a week in summer.&#160;<br><br> Eragon clamped his mouth shut as his gorge rose and turned his attention elsewhere to keep from retching.&#160;<br><br> A few paces away, Roran lay crumpled against the side of the cave, where he too had landed. Even as Eragon watched, his cousin lifted an arm and pushed himself onto all fours and then to his feet. His eyes were glazed, and he tottered as if drunk.&#160;<br> Behind Roran, the two Ra&rsquo;zac emerged from a nearby tunnel. They wielded long, pale blades of an ancient design in their mal formed hands. Unlike their parents, the Ra&rsquo;zac were roughly the same size and shape as humans. An ebony exoskeleton encased them from top to bottom, although little of it showed, for even in Helgrind, the Ra&rsquo;zac wore dark robes and cloaks.&#160;<br><br> They advanced with startling swiftness, their movements sharp and jerky like those of an insect.&#160;<br><br> And yet, Eragon still could not sense them or the Lethrblaka.&#160;<i>Are they an illusion too?&#160;</i>he wondered. But no, that was nonsense; the &#64258;esh Saphira tore at with her talons was real enough. Another explanation occurred to him: perhaps it was&#160;<i>impossible&#160;</i>to detect their presence. Perhaps the Ra&rsquo;zac could conceal themselves from the minds of humans, their prey, just as spiders conceal themselves from &#64258;ies. If so, then Eragon &#64257;nally understood why the Ra&rsquo;zac had been so successful hunting magicians and Riders for Galbatorix when they themselves could not use magic.&#160;<br><br> <i>Blast!&#160;</i>Eragon would have indulged in more colorful oaths, but it was time for action, not cursing their bad luck. Brom had claimed the Ra&rsquo;zac were no match for him in broad daylight, and while that might have been true&mdash;given that Brom had had decades to invent spells to use against the Ra&rsquo;zac&mdash;Eragon knew that, without the ad vantage of surprise, he, Saphira, and Roran would be hard- pressed to escape with their lives, much less rescue Katrina.&#160;<br><br> Raising his right hand above his head, Eragon cried,&#160;<i>&ldquo;Brisingr!&rdquo;&#160;</i>and threw a roaring &#64257;reball toward the Ra&rsquo;zac. They dodged, and the &#64257;reball splashed against the rock &#64258;oor, guttered for a moment, and then winked out of existence. The spell was silly and childish and could cause no conceivable damage if Galbatorix had protected the Ra&rsquo;zac like the Lethrblaka. Still, Eragon found the attack immensely satisfying. It also distracted the Ra&rsquo;zac long enough for Eragon to dash over to Roran and press his back against his cousin&rsquo;s.&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;Hold them off for a minute,&rdquo; he shouted, hoping Roran would hear. Whether he did or not, Roran grasped Eragon&rsquo;s meaning, for he covered himself with his shield and lifted his hammer in prepa ration to &#64257;ght.&#160;<br><br> The amount of force contained within each of the Lethrblaka&rsquo;s terrible blows had already depleted the wards against physical danger that Eragon had placed around Saphira. Without them, the Lethrblaka had in&#64258;icted several rows of scratches&mdash;long but shallow&mdash;along her thighs and had managed to stab her three times with their beaks; those wounds were short but deep and caused her a great deal of pain.&#160;<br> In return, Saphira had laid open the ribs of one Lethrblaka and had bitten off the last three feet of the other&rsquo;s tail. The Lethrblaka&rsquo;s blood, to Eragon&rsquo;s astonishment, was a metallic blue-green, not unlike the verdigris that forms on aged copper.&#160;<br><br> At the moment, the Lethrblaka had withdrawn from Saphira and were circling her, lunging now and then in order to keep her at bay while they waited for her to tire or until they could kill her with a stab from one of their beaks.&#160;<br><br> Saphira was better suited than the Lethrblaka to open combat by virtue of her scales&mdash;which were harder and tougher than the Lethrblaka&rsquo;s gray hide&mdash;and her teeth&mdash;which were far more lethal in close quarters than the Lethrblaka&rsquo;s beaks&mdash;but despite all that, she had dif&#64257;culty fending off both creatures at once, especially since the ceiling prevented her from leaping and &#64258;ying about and other wise outmaneuvering her foes. Eragon feared that even if she prevailed, the Lethrblaka would maim her before she slew them.&#160;<br><br> Taking a quick breath, Eragon cast a single spell that contained every one of the twelve techniques of killing that Oromis had taught him. He was careful to phrase the incantation as a series of processes, so that if Galbatorix&rsquo;s wards foiled him, he could sever the &#64258;ow of magic. Otherwise, the spell might consume his strength until he died.&#160;<br><br> It was well he took the precaution. Upon release of the spell, Eragon quickly became aware that the magic was having no effect upon the Lethrblaka, and he abandoned the assault. He had not expected to succeed with the traditional death-words, but he had to try, on the slight chance Galbatorix might have been careless or ignorant when he had placed wards upon the Lethrblaka and their spawn.&#160;<br><br> Behind him, Roran shouted, &ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; An instant later, a sword thudded against his shield, followed by the tinkle of rippling mail and the bell-like peal of a second sword bouncing off Roran&rsquo;s helm.&#160;<br><br> Eragon realized that his hearing must be improving.&#160;<br><br> The Ra&rsquo;zac struck again and again, but each time their weapons glanced off Roran&rsquo;s armor or missed his face and limbs by a hairs breadth, no matter how fast they swung their blades. Roran was too slow to retaliate, but neither could the Ra&rsquo;zac harm him. They hissed with frustration and spewed a continuous stream of invec tives, which seemed all the more foul because of how the creatures&rsquo; hard, clacking jaws mangled the language.&#160;<br><br> Eragon smiled. The cocoon of charms he had spun around Roran had done its job. He hoped the invisible net of energy would hold until he could &#64257;nd a way to halt the Lethrblaka.&#160;<br><br> Everything shivered and went gray around Eragon as the two Lethrblaka shrieked in unison. For a moment, his resolve deserted him, leaving him unable to move, then he rallied and shook himself as a dog might, casting off their fell in&#64258;uence. The sound reminded him of nothing so much as a pair of children screaming in pain.&#160;<br> Then Eragon began to chant as fast as he could without mispronouncing the ancient language. Each sentence he uttered, and they were legion, contained the potential to deliver instant death, and each death was unique among its fellows. As he recited his improvised soliloquy, Saphira received another cut upon her left &#64258;ank. In return, she broke the wing of her assailant, slashing the thin &#64258;ight membrane into ribbons with her claws. A number of heavy impacts transmitted themselves from Roran&rsquo;s back to Eragon&rsquo;s as the Ra&rsquo;zac hacked and stabbed in a&#160; lightning-quick frenzy. The largest of the two Ra&rsquo;zac began to edge around Roran, in order to attack Eragon directly.&#160;<br> And then, amid the din of steel against steel, and steel against wood, and claws against stone, there came the scrape of a sword sliding through mail, followed by a wet crunch. Roran yelled, and Eragon felt blood splash across the calf of his right leg.&#160;<br><br> Out of the corner of one eye, Eragon watched as a humpbacked &#64257;gure leaped toward him, extending its leaf-bladed sword so as to impale him. The world seemed to contract around the thin, narrow point; the tip glittered like a shard of crystal, each scratch a thread of quicksilver in the bright light of dawn.&#160;<br><br> He only had time for one more spell before he would have to devote himself to stopping the Ra&rsquo;zac from inserting the sword between his liver and kidneys. In desperation, he gave up trying to directly harm the Lethrblaka and instead cried, &ldquo;Garjzla, letta!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> It was a crude spell, constructed in haste and poorly worded, yet it worked. The bulbous eyes of the Lethrblaka with the broken wing became a matched set of mirrors, each a perfect hemisphere, as Eragon&rsquo;s magic re&#64258;ected the light that otherwise would have en tered the Lethrblaka&rsquo;s pupils. Blind, the creature stumbled and &#64258;ailed at the air in a vain attempt to hit Saphira.&#160;<br><br> Eragon spun the hawthorn staff in his hands and knocked aside the Ra&rsquo;zac&rsquo;s sword when it was less than an inch from his ribs. The Ra&rsquo;zac landed in front of him and jutted out its neck. Eragon recoiled as a short, thick beak appeared from within the depths of its hood. The chitinous appendage snapped shut just short of his right eye. In a rather detached way, Eragon noticed that the Ra&rsquo;zac&rsquo;s tongue was barbed and purple and writhed like a headless snake.&#160;<br><br> Bringing his hands together at the center of the staff, Eragon drove his arms forward, striking the Ra&rsquo;zac across its hollow chest and throwing the monster back several yards. It fell upon its hands and knees. Eragon pivoted around Roran, whose left side was slick with blood, and parried the sword of the other Ra&rsquo;zac. He feinted, beat the Ra&rsquo;zac&rsquo;s blade, and, when the Ra&rsquo;zac stabbed at his throat, whirled the other half of the staff across his body and de&#64258;ected the thrust. Without pausing, Eragon lunged forward and planted the wooden end of the staff in the Ra&rsquo;zac&rsquo;s abdomen.&#160;<br><br> If Eragon had been wielding Zar&rsquo;roc, he would have killed the Ra&rsquo;zac then and there. As it was, something cracked inside the Ra&rsquo;zac, and the creature went rolling across the cave for a dozen or more paces. It immediately popped up again, leaving a smear of blue gore on the uneven rock.&#160;<br><br> <i>I need a sword,&#160;</i>thought Eragon.&#160;<br><br> He widened his stance as the two Ra&rsquo;zac converged upon him; he had no choice but to hold his ground and face their combined on slaught, for he was all that stood between those&#160; hook-clawed carrion crows and Roran. He began to mouth the same spell that had proved itself against the Lethrblaka, but the Ra&rsquo;zac executed high and low slashes before he could utter a syllable.&#160;<br><br> The swords rebounded off the hawthorn with a dull&#160;<i>bonk</i>. They did not dent or otherwise mar the enchanted wood.&#160;<br><br> Left, right, up, down. Eragon did not think; he acted and reacted as he exchanged a &#64258;urry of blows with the Ra&rsquo;zac. The staff was ideal for &#64257;ghting multiple opponents, as he could strike and block with both ends, and often simultaneously. That ability served him well now. He panted, each breath short and quick. Sweat dripped from his brow and gathered at the corners of his eyes, and a layer greased his back and the undersides of his arms. The red haze of battle dimmed his vision and throbbed in response to the convulsions of his heart.&#160;<br><br> He never felt so alive, or afraid, as he did when &#64257;ghting.&#160;<br><br> Eragon&rsquo;s own wards were scant. Since he had lavished the bulk of his attention on Saphira and Roran, Eragon&rsquo;s magical defenses soon failed, and the smaller Ra&rsquo;zac wounded him on the outside of his left knee. The injury was not life-threatening, but it was still serious, for his left leg would no longer support his full weight.&#160;<br><br> Gripping the spike at the bottom, Eragon swung the staff like a club and bashed one Ra&rsquo;zac upside the head. The Ra&rsquo;zac collapsed, but whether it was dead or only unconscious, Eragon could not tell. Advancing upon the remaining Ra&rsquo;zac, he battered the creature&rsquo;s arms and shoulders and, with a sudden twist, knocked the sword out of its hand.&#160;<br><br> Before Eragon could &#64257;nish off the Ra&rsquo;zac, the blinded, broken-winged Lethrblaka &#64258;ew the width of the cave and slammed against the far wall, knocking loose a shower of stone &#64258;akes from the ceiling. The sight and sound were so colossal, they caused Eragon, Roran, and the Ra&rsquo;zac to &#64258;inch and turn, simply out of instinct.&#160;<br> Jumping after the crippled Lethrblaka, which she had just kicked, Saphira sank her teeth into the back of the creature&rsquo;s sinewy neck.&#160;<br><br> The Lethrblaka thrashed in one &#64257;nal effort to free itself, and then Saphira whipped her head from side to side and broke its spine. Rising from her bloody kill, Saphira &#64257;lled the cave with a savage roar of victory.&#160;<br><br> The remaining Lethrblaka did not hesitate. Tackling Saphira, it dug its claws underneath the edges of her scales and pulled her into an uncontrolled tumble. Together they rolled to the lip of the cave, teetered for a half second, and then dropped out of sight, battling the whole way. It was a clever tactic, for it carried the Lethrblaka out of the range of Eragon&rsquo;s senses, and that which he could not sense, he had dif&#64257;culty casting a spell against.&#160;<br><br> <i>Saphira!&#160;</i>cried Eragon.&#160;<br><br> <i>Tend to yourself. This one won&rsquo;t escape me.&#160;</i><br><br> With a start, Eragon whirled around just in time to see the two Ra&rsquo;zac vanish into the depths of the nearest tunnel, the smaller supporting the larger. Closing his eyes, Eragon located the minds of the prisoners in Helgrind, muttered a burst of the ancient language, then said to Roran, &ldquo;I sealed off Katrina&rsquo;s cell so the Ra&rsquo;zac can&rsquo;t use her as a hostage. Only you and I can open the door now.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Roran through clenched teeth. &ldquo;Can you do something about this?&rdquo; He jerked his chin toward the spot he had clamped his right hand over. Blood welled between his &#64257;ngers. Eragon probed the wound. As soon as he touched it, Roran &#64258;inched and recoiled.&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky,&rdquo; said Eragon. &ldquo;The sword hit a rib.&rdquo; Placing one hand on the injury and the other on the twelve diamonds concealed inside the belt of Beloth the Wise strapped around his waist, Eragon drew upon the power he had stored within the gems. &ldquo;Wa&iacute;se heill!&rdquo; A ripple traversed Roran&rsquo;s side as the magic knit his skin and muscle back together again.&#160;<br><br> Then Eragon healed his own wound: the gash on his left knee.&#160;<br><br> Finished, he straightened and glanced in the direction that Saphira had gone. His connection with her was fading as she chased the Lethrblaka toward Leona Lake. He yearned to help her but knew that, for the time being, she would have to fend for herself.&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;Hurry,&rdquo; said Roran. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re getting away!&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;Right.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> <br> Hefting his staff, Eragon approached the unlit tunnel and &#64258;icked his gaze from one stone protrusion to another, expecting the Ra&rsquo;zac to spring out from behind one of them. He moved slowly in order that his footsteps would not echo in the winding shaft. When he hap pened to touch a rock to steady himself, he found it coated in slime.&#160;<br><br> After a score of yards, several folds and twists in the passageway hid the main cavern and plunged them into a gloom so profound, even Eragon found it impossible to see.&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re different, but I can&rsquo;t &#64257;ght in the dark,&rdquo; whispered Roran.&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;If I make a light, the Ra&rsquo;zac won&rsquo;t come near us, not when I now know a spell that works on them. They&rsquo;ll just hide until we leave. We have to kill them while we have the chance.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;What am I supposed to do? I&rsquo;m more likely to run into a wall and&#160;break my nose than I am to &#64257;nd those two beetles....They could&#160;sneak around behind us and stab us in the back.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;Shh....Hold on to my belt, follow me, and be ready to duck.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> Eragon could not see, but he could still hear, smell, touch, and taste, and those faculties were sensitive enough that he had a fair idea of what lay nearby. The greatest danger was that the Ra&rsquo;zac would attack from a distance, perhaps with a bow, but he trusted that his re&#64258;exes were sharp enough to save Roran and himself from an oncoming missile.&#160;<br><br> A current of air tickled Eragon&rsquo;s skin, then paused and reversed itself as pressure from the outside waxed and waned. The cycle repeated itself at inconsistent intervals, creating invisible eddies that brushed against him like fountains of roiling water.&#160;<br><br> His breathing, and Roran&rsquo;s, was loud and ragged compared with&#160;the odd assortment of sounds that propagated through the tunnel.&#160;<br><br> Above the gusts of their respiration, Eragon caught the&#160;<i>tink, clink, clatter&#160;</i>of a stone falling somewhere in the tangle of branching tubes and the steady&#160;<i>doink . . . doink . . . doink&#160;</i>of condensed droplets striking the drumlike surface of a subterranean pool. He also heard the grind of pea- sized gravel crushed underneath the soles of his boots. A long, eerie moan wavered somewhere far ahead of them.&#160;<br><br> Of smells, none were new: sweat, blood, damp, and mold.&#160;<br><br> Step by step, Eragon led the way as they burrowed farther into the bowels of Helgrind. The tunnel slanted downward and often split or turned, so that Eragon would have soon been lost if he had not been able to use Katrina&rsquo;s mind as a reference point. The vari&shy;ous knobby holes were low and cramped. Once, when Eragon bumped his head against the ceiling, a sudden &#64258;are of claustrophobia unnerved him.&#160;<br><br> <i>I&rsquo;m back,&#160;</i>Saphira announced just as Eragon put his foot on a&#160;rugged step hewn out of the rock below him. He paused. She had escaped additional injury, which relieved him.&#160;<br><br> <i>And the Lethrblaka?&#160;</i><br><br> <i>Floating belly- up in Leona Lake. I&rsquo;m afraid that some &#64257;shermen saw our battle. They were rowing toward Dras- Leona when I last saw them.</i><br> <i>&#160;</i><br> <i>Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped. See what you can &#64257;nd in the tunnel the Lethrblaka came out of. And keep an eye out for the Ra&rsquo;zac. They may try to slip past us and escape Helgrind through the entrance we used.&#160;</i><br><br> <i>They probably have a bolt-hole at ground level.&#160;</i><br><br> <i>Probably, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll run quite yet.&#160;</i><br><br> After what seemed like an hour trapped in the darkness&mdash;though Eragon knew it could not have been more than ten or &#64257;fteen minutes&mdash;and after descending more than a hundred feet through Helgrind, Eragon stopped on a level patch of stone. Transmitting his thoughts to Roran, he said,&#160;<i>Katrina&rsquo;s cell is about &#64257;fty feet in front of us, on the right</i>.&#160;<br><br> <i>We can&rsquo;t risk letting her out until the Ra&rsquo;zac are dead or gone.&#160;</i><br><br> <i>What if they won&rsquo;t reveal themselves until we do let her out? For some reason, I can&rsquo;t sense them. They could hide from me until doomsday in here. So do we wait for who knows how long, or do we free Katrina while we still have the chance? I can place some wards around her that should&#160;protect her from most attacks.&#160;</i><br><br> <br> Roran was quiet for a second.&#160;<i>Let&rsquo;s free her, then</i>.&#160;<br><br> <br> They began to move forward again, feeling their way along the squat corridor with its rough, un&#64257;nished &#64258;oor. Eragon had to devote most of his attention to his footing in order to maintain his balance.&#160;<br><br> <br> As a result, he almost missed the swish of cloth sliding over cloth and then the faint <i>twang&#160;</i>that emanated from off to his right.&#160;<br><br> <br> He recoiled against the wall, shoving Roran back. At the same time, something augered past his face, carving a groove of &#64258;esh from his right cheek. The thin trench burned as if cauterized.&#160;<br><br> <br> &ldquo;Kveykva!&rdquo; shouted Eragon.&#160;<br><br> <br> Red light, bright as the midday sun, &#64258;ared into existence. It had no source, and thus it illuminated every surface evenly and without shadows, giving things a curious &#64258;at appearance. The sudden blaze dazzled Eragon, but it did more than that to the lone Ra&rsquo;zac in front of him; the creature dropped its bow, covered its hooded face, and screamed high and shrill. A similar screech told Eragon that the second Ra&rsquo;zac was behind them.&#160;<br><br> <br> <i>Roran!&#160;</i><br><br> <br> Eragon pivoted just in time to see Roran charge the other Ra&rsquo;zac, hammer held high. The disoriented monster stumbled backward but was too slow. The hammer fell. &ldquo;For my father!&rdquo; shouted Roran. He struck again. &ldquo;For our home!&rdquo; The Ra&rsquo;zac was already dead, but Roran lifted the hammer once more. &ldquo;For Carvahall!&rdquo; His &#64257;nal blow shattered the Ra&rsquo;zac&rsquo;s carapace like the rind of a dry gourd. In the merciless ruby glare, the spreading pool of blood appeared purple.&#160;<br><br> Spinning his staff in a circle to knock aside the arrow or sword that he was convinced was driving toward him, Eragon turned to confront the remaining Ra&rsquo;zac. The tunnel before them was empty. He swore.&#160;<br><br> Eragon strode over to the twisted &#64257;gure on the &#64258;oor. He swung&#160;the staff over his head and brought it down across the chest of the&#160;dead Ra&rsquo;zac with a resounding thud.<br><br> &#160;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited a long time to do that,&rdquo; said Eragon. &ldquo;As have I.&rdquo; He and Roran looked at each other. &ldquo;Ahh!&rdquo; cried Eragon, and clutched his cheek as the pain intensi&#64257;ed. <br> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bubbling!&rdquo; exclaimed Roran. &ldquo;Do something!&rdquo;&#160;<br> <i>The Ra&rsquo;zac must have coated the arrowhead with Seithr oil,&#160;</i>thought&#160;Eragon. <br> Remembering his training, he cleansed the wound and surrounding tissue with an incantation and then repaired the damage to his face. He opened and closed his mouth several times to make sure the muscles were working properly. With a grim smile, he said, &ldquo;Imagine the state we&rsquo;d be in without magic.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> &ldquo;Without magic, we wouldn&rsquo;t have Galbatorix to worry about.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> <i>Talk later,&#160;</i>said Saphira.&#160;<i>As soon as those &#64257;shermen reach Dras-Leona, the king may hear of our doings from one of his pet spellcasters in the city, and we do not want Galbatorix scrying Helgrind while we are still here</i>.&#160;<br><br> <i>Yes, yes,&#160;</i>said Eragon. Extinguishing the omnipresent red glow, he said, &ldquo;Brisingr raudhr,&rdquo; and created a red werelight like that from the previous night, except that this one remained anchored six inches from the ceiling instead of accompanying Eragon wherever he went.&#160;<br><br> Now that he had an opportunity to examine the tunnel in some detail, Eragon saw that the stone hallway was dotted with twenty or so ironbound doors, some on either side. He pointed and said, &ldquo;Ninth down, on the right. You go get her. I&rsquo;ll check the other cells. The Ra&rsquo;zac might have left something interesting in them.&rdquo;&#160;<br><br> Roran nodded. Crouching, he searched the corpse at their feet but found no keys. He shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it the hard way, then.&rdquo; He sprinted to the proper door, abandoned his shield, and set to work on the hinges with his hammer. Each blow created a frightful crash.&#160;<br><br> Eragon did not offer to help. His cousin would not want or appreciate assistance now, and besides, there was something else Eragon had to do. He went to the &#64257;rst cell, whispered three words, then, after the lock snapped open, pushed aside the door. All that the small room contained was a black chain and a pile of rotting bones. Those sad remains were no more than he had expected; he already knew where the object of his search lay, but he maintained the charade of ignorance to avoid kindling Roran&rsquo;s suspicion.&#160;<br><br> Two more doors opened and closed beneath the touch of Eragon&rsquo;s &#64257;ngers. Then, at the fourth cell, the door swung back to admit the shifting radiance of the werelight and reveal the very man Eragon had hoped he would not &#64257;nd: Sloan.",

      excerpt:
        "LYRA didn&#8217;t often climb out of her bedroom window these days. She had a better way onto the roof of Jordan College: the Porter had given her a key that let her onto the roof of the Lodge Tower. He&#8217;d let her have it because he was too old to climb the steps and check the stonework and the lead, as was his duty four times a year; so she made a full report to him, and he passed it to the Bursar, and in exchange she was able to get out onto the roof whenever she wanted. When she lay down on the lead, she was invisible from everywhere except the sky. A little parapet ran all the way around the square roof, and Pantalaimon often draped his pine-marten form over the mock battlements on the corner facing south, and dozed while Lyra sat below with her back against the sun-drenched stone, studying the books she&#8217;d brought up with her. Sometimes they&#8217;d stop and watch the storks that nested on St. Michael&#8217;s Tower, just across Turl Street. Lyra had a plan to tempt them over to Jordan, and she&#8217;d even dragged several planks of wood up to the roof and laboriously nailed them together to make a platform, just as they&#8217;d done at St. Michael&#8217;s; but it hadn&#8217;t worked. The storks were loyal to St. Michael&#8217;s, and that was that. <br>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t stay for long if we kept on coming here, anyway,&#8221; said Pantalaimon.<br>&#8220;We could tame them. I bet we could. What do they eat?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Fish,&#8221; he guessed. &#8220;Frogs.&#8221; He was lying on top of the stone parapet, lazily grooming his red gold fur. Lyra stood up to lean on the stone beside him, her limbs full of warmth, and gazed out toward the southeast, where a dusty dark-green line of trees rose above the spires and rooftops in the early evening air.<br><br>She was waiting for the starlings. That year an extraordinary number of them had come to roost in the Botanic Garden, and every evening they would rise out of the trees like smoke, and swirl and swoop and dart through the skies above the city in their thousands.<br>&#8220;Millions,&#8221; Pan said.<br>&#8220;Maybe, easily. I don&#8217;t know who could ever count them. . . . There they are!&#8221; They didn&#8217;t seem like individual birds, or even individual dots of black against the blue; it was the flock itself that was the individual. It was like a single piece of cloth, cut in a very complicated way that let it swing through itself and double over and stretch and fold in three dimensions without ever tangling, turning itself inside out and elegantly waving and crossing through and falling and rising and falling again. &#8220;If it was saying something . . . ,&#8221; said Lyra.<br>&#8220;Like signaling.&#8221;<br>&#8220;No one would know, though. No one could ever understand what it meant.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Maybe it means nothing. It just is.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Everything means something,&#8221; Lyra said severely. &#8220;We just have to find out how to read it.&#8221; Pantalaimon leapt across a gap in the parapet to the stone in the corner, and stood on his hind legs, balancing with his tail and gazing more intently at the vast swirling flock over the far side of the city.<br>&#8220;What does that mean, then?&#8221; he said. She knew exactly what he was referring to. She was watching it too. Something was jarring or snagging at the smokelike, flaglike, ceaseless motion of the starlings, as if that miraculous multidimensional cloth had found itself unable to get rid of a knot.<br>&#8220;They&#8217;re attacking something,&#8221; Lyra said, shading her eyes. And coming closer. Lyra could hear them now, too: a high-pitched angry mindless shriek. The bird at the center of the swirling anger was darting to right and left, now speeding upward, now dropping almost to the rooftops, and when it was no closer than the spire of the University Church, and before they could even see what kind of bird it was, Lyra and Pan found themselves shaking with surprise. For it wasn&#8217;t a bird, although it was bird-shaped; it was a d&#230;mon. A witch&#8217;s d&#230;mon.<br>&#8220;Has anyone else seen it? Is anyone looking?&#8221; said Lyra. Pan&#8217;s black eyes swept every rooftop, every window in sight, while Lyra leaned out and looked up and down the street on one side and then darted to the other three sides to look into Jordan&#8217;s front quadrangle and along the roof as well. The citizens of Oxford were going about their daily business, and a noise of birds in the sky wasn&#8217;t interesting enough to disturb them. Just as well: because a d&#230;mon was instantly recognizable as what he was, and to see one without his human would have caused a sensation, if not an outcry of fear and horror. &#8220;Oh, this way, this way!&#8221; Lyra said urgently, unwilling to shout, but jumping up and waving both arms; and Pan too was trying to attract the d&#230;mon&#8217;s attention, leaping from stone to stone, flowing across the gaps and spinning around to leap back again. The birds were closer now, and Lyra could see the d&#230;mon clearly: a dark bird about the size of a thrush, but with long arched wings and a forked tail. Whatever he&#8217;d done to anger the starlings, they were possessed by fear and rage, swooping, stabbing, tearing, trying to batter him out of the air.<br>&#8220;This way! Here, here!&#8221; Pan cried, and Lyra flung open the trapdoor to give the d&#230;mon a way of escape. The noise, now that the starlings were nearly overhead, was deafening, and Lyra thought that people below must be looking up to see this war in the sky. And there were so many birds, as thick as flakes in a blizzard of black snow, that Lyra, her arm across her head, lost sight of the d&#230;mon among them. But Pan had him. As the d&#230;mon-bird dived low toward the tower, Pan stood up on his hind legs, and then leapt up to gather the d&#230;mon in his paws and roll with him over and over toward the trapdoor, and they fell through clumsily as Lyra struck out with her fists to left and right and then tumbled through after the two d&#230;mons, dragging the trapdoor shut behind her.",

      excerpt:
        "Chapter 1<br>What Torren Saw<br><br>Torren was out at the edge of the cabbage field that day, the day the people came. He was supposed to be fetching a couple of cabbages for Dr. Hester to use in the soup that night, but, as usual, he didn't see why he shouldn't have some fun while he was at it. So he climbed up the wind tower, which he wasn't supposed to do because, they said, he might fall or get his head sliced off by the big blades going round and round.<br><br>The wind tower was four-sided, made of boards nailed one above the next like the rungs of a ladder. Torren climbed the back side of it, the side that faced the hills and not the village, so that the little group of workers hoeing the cabbage rows wouldn't see him. At the top, he turned around and sat on the flat place behind the blades, which turned slowly in the idle summer breeze. He had brought a pocketful of small stones up with him, planning on some target practice: he liked to try to hit the chickens that rummaged around between the rows of cabbages. He thought it might be fun to bounce a few pebbles off the hats of the workers, too. But before he had even taken the stones from his pocket, he caught sight of something that made him stop and stare.<br><br>Out beyond the cabbage field was another field, where young tomato and corn and squash plants were growing, and beyond that the land sloped up into a grassy hillside dotted, at this time of year, with yellow mustard flowers. Torren saw something strange at the top of the hill. Something dark.<br><br>There were bits of darkness at first-for a second he thought maybe it was a deer, or several deer, black ones instead of the usual light brown, but the shape was wrong for deer, and the way these things moved was wrong, too. He realized very soon that he was seeing people, a few people at first and then more and more of them. They came up from the other side of the hill and gathered at the top and stood there, a long line of them against the sky, like a row of black teeth. There must have been a hundred, Torren thought, or more than a hundred.<br><br>In all his life, Torren had never seen more than three or four people at a time arrive at the village from elsewhere. Almost always, the people who came were roamers, passing through with a truckload of stuff from the old towns to sell. This massing of people on<br><br>the hilltop terrified him. For a moment he couldn't move. Then his heart started up a furious pounding, and he scrambled down off the wind tower so fast that he scraped his hands on the rough boards.<br><br>&quot;Someone's coming!&quot; he shouted as he passed the workers. They looked up, startled. Torren ran at full speed toward the low cluster of brown buildings at the far end of the field. He turned up a dirt lane, his feet raising swirls of dust, and dashed through the gate in the wall and across the courtyard and in through the open door, all the time yelling, &quot;Someone's coming! Up on the hill! Auntie Hester! Someone's coming!&quot;<br><br>He found his aunt in the kitchen, and he grabbed her by the waist of her pants and cried, &quot;Come and see! There's people on the hill!&quot; His voice was so shrill and urgent and loud that his aunt dropped the spoon into the pot of soup she'd been stirring and hurried after him. By the time they got outside, others from the village were leaving their houses, too, and looking toward the hillside.<br><br>The people were coming down. Over the crest of the hill they came and kept coming, dozens of them, more and more, like a mudslide.<br><br>The people of the village crowded into the streets. &quot;Get Mary Waters!&quot; someone called. &quot;Where's Ben and Wilmer? Find them, tell them to get out here!&quot;<br><br>Torren was less frightened now that he was surrounded by the townspeople. &quot;I saw them first,&quot; he said to Hattie Carranza, who happened to be hurrying along next to him. I was the one who told the news.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is that right,&quot; said Hattie.<br><br>&quot;We won't let them do anything bad to us,&quot; said Torren. &quot;If they do, we'll do something worse to them. Won't we?&quot;<br><br>But she just glanced down at him with a vague frown and didn't answer.<br><br>The three village leaders&#8211;Mary Waters, Ben Barlow, and Wilmer Dent&#8211;had joined the crowd by now and were leading the way across the cabbage field. Torren kept close behind them. The strangers were getting nearer, and he wanted to hear what they would say. He could see that they were terrible-looking people. Their clothes were all wrong&#8211;coats and sweaters, though the weather was warm, and not nice coats and sweaters but raggedy ones, patched, unraveling, faded, and grimy. They carried bundles, all of them: sacks made of what looked like tablecloths or blankets gathered up and tied with string around the neck. They moved clumsily and slowly. Some of them tripped on the uneven ground and had to be helped up by others.<br><br>In the center of the field, where the smell of new cabbages and fresh dirt and chicken manure was strong, those at the front of the crowd of strangers met the village leaders. Mary Waters stepped to the front, and the villagers crowded up behind her. Torren, being<br>small, wriggled between people until he had a good view. He stared at the ragged people. Where were their leaders? Facing Mary were a girl and a boy who looked only a little older than he was himself. Next to them was a bald man, and next to him a sharp-eyed woman holding a small child. Maybe she was the leader.<br><br>But when Mary stepped forward and said, &quot;Who are you?&quot; it was the boy who answered. He spoke in a clear, loud voice that surprised Torren, who had expected a pitiful voice from someone so bedraggled. &quot;We come from the city of Ember,&quot; the boy said. &quot;We left there because our city was dying. We need help.&quot;<br><br>Mary, Ben, and Wilmer exchanged glances. Mary frowned. &quot;The city of Ember? Where's that? We've never heard of it. &quot;<br><br>The boy gestured back the way they had come, to the east. &quot;That way,&quot; he said. &quot;It's under the ground.&quot;",

The villagers have never had to share their world before, and it   only takes a tiny &ldquo;spark&rdquo; to ignite a battle between the two struggling   groups. Lina and Doon will have to work together to avoid a disaster not only   for their people, but also for the people of Sparks.&#160;<br><br> <u>Praise for the City of Ember books:</u><br> &#160;<br> <b>Nominated to 28 State Award Lists!</b><br> <b>An American Library Association Notable Children&rsquo;s Book</b><br> <b>A New York Public Library 100 Titles for Reading and Sharing Selection</b><br> <b>A Kirkus Reviews Editors&rsquo; Choice</b><br> <b>A Child Magazine Best Children&rsquo;s Book</b><br> <b>A Mark Twain Award Winner</b><br> <b>A William Allen White Children&rsquo;s Book Award Winner</b><br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;A realistic post-apocalyptic world.

      excerpt:
        "There were spells written deep within the walls that surrounded the Balitang home. They appeared as a shimmering silver blaze in Aly&#8217;s Sight. As the processsion passed through the gate, she saw magic sunk below the stones, wood, and carvings. It was partially covered by common magical signs for protection and health that any house possessed. They gleamed silver in the carving on the foundation stones and front steps. Unless someone else in Rajmuat had the Sight in the strength Aly had it, no one would see anything but the everyday spells. The raka mages were very good at keeping their work hidden.<br>Ornately carved pillars lined the long front porch and framed the front door of Balitang House. The roof was layered, each lesser roof sporting upturned ends. After the summer&#8217;s heat and rains, and the winter&#8217;s cold and rains, with no staff to keep the place up, the house should have looked run-down. But this house gleamed. Not one clay tile was missing from the roof. The stucco was the color of fresh milk. Gold and silver leaf glimmered on the eaves and on the carved wood above the posts.<br>The staff was lined up on either side of the flagstone road. They wore luarin tunics and breeches or hose, raka wrapped jackets and sarongs, or combinations of styles in an explosion of colors that made Aly blink. Housemaids wore white headcloths; the men wore round white caps. They all looked to be wearing every piece of jewelry they owned.<br>Aly counted. Nearly sixty people were here, not including the men-at-arms. Balitang House was as fully staffed as it had been the previous spring.<br>The duchess could not afford this. When King Oron had exiled them, he had made them show their loyalty with gold, emptying Duke Mequen&#8217;s coffers. Winnamine had drawn on her dowry to pay household costs. If Prince Rubinyan had not virtually commanded her to return to court, she would have remained at Tanair, which was affordable.<br>&#8220;Fesgao,&#8221; Aly murmured. The man had come to stand by her elbow. &#8220;Who&#8217;s paying for this?&#8221;<br>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; the raka man told her. &#8220;It seems our situation has changed. Ulasim will explain.&#8221; He went to help the duchess out of the litter.<br>Aly looked at the steps. Ulasim waited there on the ground, smiling. He was a hard-muscled man, in his forties with the brown skin of a full-blood raka. His nose had been mashed against his face on several occasions by someone not kindly disposed toward him. A tightness in Aly&#8217;s heart loosened at the sight of the head footman. He was the leader of the far-flung raka conspiracy, wise and strong at every trial.  He had drawn Aly from suspicion to respect. Back under Ulasim&#8217;s wing, the Balitang family seemed much less exposed. Back under Ulasim&#8217;s eye, Aly could turn to her specialty and leave him to deal with assassins and alliances.<br>The big raka bowed to Winnamine. As Aly watched, reading his lips, Ulasim told the duchess that they had not spent money they did not have. He reassured her that all would be explained to her satisfaction. once she&#8217;d had a chance to eat and rest. As he soothed her, Aly identified a familiar face at Ulasim&#8217;s elbow. Quedanga, the housekeeper since Sarai was born, had stayed in Rajmuat when the family left the city. She had now returned to Balitang House.<br>&#8220;How did they afford this?&#8221; Dove murmured as Aly handed her down from the litter.<br>&#8220;It will be a lovely tale,&#8221; Aly replied, her voice sweet. &#8220;Some parts may even be true.&#8221;<br>Dove looked up at Aly, smiling slightly. &#8220;You sound as if you wouldn&#8217;t put it past them to have raided the royal treasury.&#8221;<br>Aly raised an eyebrow at her mistress. &#8220;Do you think they wouldn&#8217;t, my lady?&#8221;<br>Dove sighed. &#8220;I hope not. It would complicate things.&#8221; Dove had understatement down to an art.<br>Hands folded in front of her, Aly followed Dove toward the house. They did not get far. A tall woman stepped out of the house. She was a silver-haired luarin with perfect posture. Her luarin-style gown was pale blue with a high collar. Instead of the traditional over robe, she wore a stole like the raka wrapped jacket, made of shimmering white lawn.<br>Sarai and Dove looked at each other. <u>&#8220;Aunt Nuritin,&#8221;</u> they whispered in shock. <br>Aly had heard of Nuritin Balitang&#8211;or as Sarai and Dove called her, the Dragon. Though Duke Mequen had been technically the head of the family, it was his aunt who ruled it. When he had sunk into mourning for his first duchess, it was Nuritin who had badgered him into making a new marriage and a new life. Among the Balitangs, her word was law. Among the nobles of her generation, her opinion was the first they sought.<br>It did not bode well that she looked very comfortable in Balitang House.<br>Winnamine was the first to recover. She approached the old woman with outstretched hands and an apparently genuine smile on her face. &#8220;Aunt Nuritin, it&#8217;s wonderful to see you. Girls, come greet your great-aunt. Elsren, Petranne, come.&#8221;<br>Aly looked at Ulasim and made sure the nobles couldn&#8217;t see her before she hand-signed: <u>Does she live here?</u><br>Ulasim nodded slightly.<br>Again Aly&#8217;s fingers flew. <u>Are we safe with her in the house?</u><br>Ulasim came over to whisper, &#8220;As safe as anywhere in Rajmuat. We&#8217;re stuck with the old Stormwing, and that&#8217;s that. She will learn nothing we do not allow her to.&#8221;<br>Aly shook her head. &#8220;Well, then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll all just be one happy family. What harm could come of that?&#8221;<br>Once inside, the duchess looked at her late husband&#8217;s aunt. &#8220;Lady Nuritin, may we have some time to settle in before we talk? I&#8217;m not at my best so early in the morning, and this is quite a surprise.&#8221;<br>&#8220;Of course you need rest, all of you,&#8221; the old woman said. &#8220;Go. Bathe, change, unpack, take naps if you need to. We shall have our talk after lunch, and I can explain everything then.&#8221;",

      excerpt:
        "Nawat stood against the wall, relaxed and alert. Before him two men-at-arms were preparing to shoot. Dove stood behind one archer with a handful of arrows, while the duchess held arrows for the second archer. Aly&#8217;s mind told her that the duchess would hardly consent to murder just as the first man shot. The second man shot immediately after him. Then both set fresh arrows to the string and shot steadily, arrow after arrow, one at a time, until they had exhausted all the extras held by the duchess and her stepdaughter.<br><br>Nawat caught them all with grace and ease, snatching the arrows from the air as if he had all day to do so. When the archers finished, he gathered the heap of arrows at his feet and carried them back to their owners.<br><br>He&#8217;s so fast, Aly thought in awe. I couldn&#8217;t do it, and I&#8217;m no slouch! She sighed, wishing Da were here to see it. He&#8217;d taught her to catch daggers in midair, but this game was much more hazardous.<br><br>The game was not done. The men-at-arms repeated the experiment with javelins, then hunting and combat spears. Nawat caught them all, moving so fast Aly couldn&#8217;t follow his hands. She cheered him and the men-at-arms on.<br><br>When the bell rang to remind the household it was nearly time for supper, he looked up at the applauding Aly and waved. &#8220;This is my favorite game,&#8221; he called to her. &#8220;Do you want to play?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t dare!&#8221; she cried, laughing, before she retreated into the room. She&#8217;d seen men catch knives before. She had seen the finest archers in the Queen&#8217;s Riders draw an outline in arrows of someone positioned against a wooden fence or wall, just to show they could do it. She had never seen anything like this.<br><br>Sarai and Dove ran in. Sarai smiled at Aly. &#8220;You should have seen your face! Did you know he could do that?&#8221; she asked as she collapsed on her bed.<br><br>Dove unstrung her bow, shaking her head. &#8220;He&#8217;s amazing,&#8221; she said, coiling her bowstring.<br><br>&#8220;You know, maybe this horrible old place isn&#8217;t so bad,&#8221; Sarai told the ceiling. &#8220;Not if these wonderful men keep showing up.&#8221;<br><br>Aly raised an eyebrow at her. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t try kissing him,&#8221; she warned. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be what you expect.&#8221;<br><br>Sarai wrinkled her nose. &#8220;Aly!&#8221; she complained. &#8220;I found out he eats bugs! I&#8217;m not kissing a man with bug breath!&#8221;<br><br>Aly blinked. I don&#8217;t remember him tasting of bugs when he kissed me, she thought. I&#8217;d better pay more attention next time.<br><br>Her mind promptly reined her up. This was highly improper. There would be no next time. Her task was looking after the Balitang children, not mooning over someone, particularly not a crow turned man.<br><br>Even if he could pluck arrows from the air.<br><br> <br>The next morning Aly, still on a goatherd&#8217;s hours, walked out of the keep into the dawn. The sun had just cleared the walls to light the inner courtyard and the young man who straddled a bench there. Aly stopped to watch him carefully glue pieces of feather onto the wooden shaft.<br><br>Nawat looked up at her with a smile that lit his eyes. &#8220;You are beautiful in the new light,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;If I were the Dawn Crow, I would bring you the sun to hatch as our first nestling.&#8221;<br><br>Aly blinked at him. Her heart felt strangely squeezed by some powerful emotion. She bit her lip to distract herself from a feeling that made her horribly unsure. &#8220;Have you been kissing anybody?&#8221; she asked without meaning to, and gasped. She had let words out of her mouth without thinking, which was not like her! Worse, they were such personal words, ones he might feel meant personal feelings she did not have! This was the kind of thing that other girls said, those girls who were not bored by all the young men who had courted them. How many handsome fellows had sighed compliments to Aly while, unconcerned, she had mentally wrestled with breaking a new code? At home she never cared about her suitors enough to worry if they kissed other girls. She scrambled to blot out what she&#8217;d said. &#8220;Not that it&#8217;s any of my business, but you should understand, people have a way of kissing for fun, without it meaning anything serious, and I&#8217;d hate for you to think someone wanted you to mate-feed them just because they&#8217;re kissing&#8212;&#8221; Stop babbling, her mind ordered. Aly stopped.<br><br>Nawat&#8217;s smile broadened. That disturbing light in his eyes deepened. &#8220;I have kissed no one but you, Aly,&#8221; he assured her, serious. &#8220;Why should I kiss anyone else?&#8221;<br><br>Aly gulped. You can continue this conversation, or you can talk about something less . . . giddy, she told herself. Less frightening. &#8220;You know I won&#8217;t always be around,&#8221; she said abruptly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t belong here, really.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Then I will go with you,&#8221; Nawat said. &#8220;I belong with you.&#8221;<br><br>He doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s saying, Aly told herself. He doesn&#8217;t know what that means.<br><br>She looked at him, arms folded, trying to keep any extra feelings from leaping out. &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; she asked, to change the subject to anything less dangerous. Then she grimaced. He was fletching arrows, as always.<br><br>She glanced at his bench, then bent down. He was fletching, but these arrows were heavier, and the feathers he used were not bird feathers, but Stormwing. &#8220;How did you cut them up?&#8221; she wanted to know, genuinely curious. More scraps of cut-up steel feathers lay on the bench.<br><br>Nawat pointed to a long piece of what looked like black, chipped glass. &#8220;Shiny volcano rock,&#8221; he told Aly. &#8220;Chip the edge until it is sharp. That cuts Stormwing feathers. They come from the heat of the place where Stormwings were born.&#8221;<br><br>Aly touched the glassy blade. &#8220;Obsidian,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s its name.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Nawat replied. &#8220;Shiny volcano rock.&#8221; He set a length of steel feather into a thin groove filled with glue and held it in place.<br><br>Aly didn&#8217;t see a single cut on his hands, though the feathers were lethally sharp. &#8220;Won&#8217;t they be too heavy for the glue?&#8221; she asked.<br><br>&#8220;I shaped the glue. It holds Stormwing feathers,&#8221; Nawat answered.<br><br>&#8220;Stormwings really are born in volcanoes?&#8221; Aly inquired, curious.<br><br>&#8220;In the beginning time, when they were first dreamed,&#8221; replied Nawat, setting another piece of steel feather in its slot. &#8220;Now, if carrying an egg does not kill the mother, they are born from steel eggs.&#8221; He looked at Aly and sighed, his dark eyes wistful. &#8220;The eggs are too heavy for a crow to take.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You&#8217;ve already taken enough from Stormwings,&#8221; Aly told him, pointing to the small pile of glinting feathers beside his bench. &#8220;You could have been killed.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;There is a trick to it,&#8221; he replied, and blew lightly on his fletchings. Holding the arrow shaft before one eye, he squinted down its length. &#8220;Perfect,&#8221; he declared, and set the arrow down.<br><br>&#8220;It seems like a lot of trouble and risk when goose feathers are safer to work with,&#8221; Aly remarked. &#8220;What is a Stormwing-fletched arrow for, anyway?&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;They are mage killers,&#8221; replied Nawat. &#8220;No matter if the mage is powerful, if he has great spells to protect him. A Stormwing arrow will cut through illusion and magic.&#8221;<br><br>Aly whistled softly, impressed. &#8220;Take very good care of those, then,&#8221; she told Nawat. &#8220;We might find a use for them.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;I made them for you,&#8221; Nawat said, giving her that radiant, innocent smile. &#8220;They are yours, for a day when they will help you.&#8221; He offered a finished arrow shaft to her.<br><br>Aly smiled at him despite the goose bumps that rippled along her skin. &#8220;Keep them until they&#8217;re needed, please,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;My archery skills aren&#8217;t very good.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;You could practice,&#8221; Nawat pointed out.<br><br>&#8220;I&#8217;m a slave,&#8221; Aly explained. &#8220;Slaves who are caught with weapons are killed.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Then do not be a slave,&#8221; he said matter-of-factly. &#8220;Fly free.&#8221;<br><br>&#8220;Not just yet,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see the summer out first.&#8221;",

But more fun-loving Aly follows in the footsteps of her father, delighting in knowledge and the art of spying. This causes an ongoing rift between Aly and her mother, who thinks Aly should be focused on her future. Early in the story, Aly is captured and sold as a slave to an exiled royal family in the newly realized realm of the Copper Isles. It is in these unusual circumstances that Aly finds her own calling and in doing so gains a new understanding for her mother and the ways that they are alike.

      excerpt:
        "Decisions<br><br>Alanna the Lioness, the Kino Champion, could hardly contain her glee. Baron Piers of Mindeldan had written to King Jonathan to say that his daughter wished to be a page. Alanna fought to sit still as she watched Wyldon of Cavall, the royal training master, read the barons letter. Seated across his desk from them, the king watched the trainig master as sharply as his Champion did. Lord Wyldon was known for his dislike of female warriors.<br><br>It had been ten long years since the proclamation that girls might attempt a page&#8217;s training Alanna had nearly given up hope that such a girl- or the kind of family that would allow her to do so-,existed in Tortall, but at last she had come forward. Keladry of Mindelan would not have to hide her sex for eight years as Alanna had done. Keladry would prove to the world that girls could be knights. And she would not be friendless. Alanna had plans to help Keladry through the first few years. It never occurred to the Champion that anyone might object. <br><br>Alanna, half turned to see Wyldon better. Surely he'd read the letter at least twice! From this side the puffy scars from his battle to save the younger princes and princess were starkly visible; Wyldod&#8217;s right arm was in a sling yet from that fight. Alanna rubbed fingers that itched with the urge to apply healing magic. Wyldon had the idea that suffering pain made a warrior stronger. He would not thank her if she tried to heal him now. <br><br>Goddess bless, she thought tiredly. How will I ever get on with him if I'm to help this girl Keladry? <br><br>Wyldon was not flexible: he'd proved that to the entire court over and over. If he were any stiffer, Alanna thought wryly, I&#8217;d paint a design on him and use him for a shield. He's got no sense of humor and he rejects change just because it's change. <br><br>Still, she had to admit that his teaching worked. During the Immortals War of the spring and early summer, when legendary creatures had joined with the realm&#8217;s human enemies to take the kingdom, the squires and pages had been forced into battle. They had done well, thanks to their training by Wyldon and the teachers he had picked. <br><br>At last Lord Wyldon returned the letter to King Jonathan, who placed it on his desk. &quot;The baron and the baroness of Mindelan are faithful servants of the crown,&#8221; the king remarked. &#8220;We would not have this treaty with the Yamani Islands were it not for them. You will have read that their daughter received some warrior training at the Yamani court, so it would appear that Keladry has an aptitude.&quot; <br><br>Lord Wyldon resettled his arm in its sling. &quot;I did not agree to this, Your Majesty.&quot; <br><br>Alanna was about to say that he didn&#8217;t have to agree when she saw the king give the tiniest shake of the head. Clenching her jaws, she kept her remark to herself as King Jonathan raised his eyebrows. <br><br>&quot;Your predecessor agreed,&quot; he reminded Wyldon. &quot;And you, my lord, implied agreement when you accepted the post of training master.&quot; <br><br>&quot;That is a lawyer's reply, sire,&#8221; Wyldon replied stiffly, a slight flush rising in his cean-shaven cheeks. <br><br>&quot;Then here is a king's: we desire this girl to train as a page.&quot; <br><br>And that is that, Alanna thought, satisfied. She might be the kind of knight who would argue with her king, at least in private, but Wyldon would never let himself do so. <br><br>The training master absently rubbed the arm in its linen sling. At last he bowed in his chair. &quot;May we compromise, sire?&quot; <br><br>Alanna stiffened. She hated that word! &quot;Com---&quot; she began to say. <br><br>The king silenced her with a look. &quot;What do you want, my lord?&quot; <br><br>&quot;In all honesty,&quot; said the training master, thinking aloud, &quot;I had thought that our noble parents loved their daughters too much to place them in so hard a life.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Not everyone is afraid to do anything new,&quot; Alanna replied sharply. <br><br>&quot;Lioness,&quot; said the king, his voice dangerously quiet. Alanna clenched her fists. What was going on? Was Jonathan inclined to give way to the man who'd saved his children? <br><br>Wyldon's eyes met hers squarely. &quot;Your bias is known, Lady Alanna.&quot; To the king he said, &quot;Surely the girl's parents cannot be aware of the difficulties she will encounter.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Baron Piers and Lady Ilane are not fools&#8221; replied King Jonathan. &quot;They have given us three good, worthy knights already,&quot; <br><br>Lord Wyldon gave a reluctant nod. Anders, Inness, and Conal of Mindelan were credits to their training. The realm would feel the loss of Anders-whose war wounds could never heal entirely-from the active duty rolls. It would take years to replace those who were killed or maimed in the Immortals War. <br><br>&quot;Sire, please, think this through,&#8221; Wyldon said. &quot;We need the realm&#8217;s sons. Girls are fragile, more emotional, easier to frighten. They are not as strong in their arms and shoulders as men. They tire easily. This girl would get any warriors who serve with her killed on some dark night.<br><br>Alanna started to get up. This time King Jonathan walked out from behind his desk. Standing beside his Champion, he gripped one of her shoulders, keeping her in her chair. <br><br>&quot;.But I will be fair,&quot; Wyldon continued. His brown eyes were hard. &#8220;Let her be on probation for a year. By the end of the summer field camp, if she has not convinced me of her ability to keep up, she must go home.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Who judges her fitness?&quot; inquired the king. <br><br>Wyldon&#8217;s lips tightened. &quot;Who but the training master, sire? I have the most experience in evaluating the young for their roles as future knights.&quot; <br><br>Alanna turned to stare at the king. &quot;No boy has ever undergone a probationary period!&quot; she cried. <br><br>Wyldon raised his good shoulder in a shrug. &quot;Perhaps they should. For now, I will not tender my resignation over this, provided I judge whether this girl stays or goes in one year's time.&quot; <br><br>The king weighed the request. Alanna fidgeted. She knew Lord Wyldon meant his threat, and the crown needed him. Too many great nobles, dismayed by the changes in Tortall. since Jonathan&#8217;s coronation, felt that Wyldon was their voice at court. If he resigned, the king and queen would find it hard to get support for their future changes. <br><br>At last King Jonathan said, &quot;Though we do not always agree, my lord, you know I respect you because you are fair and honorable. I would hate to see that fairness, that honor, tainted in any way. Keladry of Mindelan shall have a year's probation.&quot;",

      excerpt:
        "Despite the overflow of humanity present for the congress at the royal palace, the hall where Keladry of Mimdelan walked was deserted. There were no servants to be seen. No echo of the footsteps, laughter, or talk that filled the sprawling residence sounded here, only Kel's steps and the click of her dog's claws on the stone floor. <br><br>They made an interesting pair. The fourteen-year-old girl was big for her age, five feet nine inches tall, and dressed informally in breeches and shirt. Both were a dark green that emphasized the same color in her green-hazel eyes. Her dark boots were comfortable, not fashionable. On her belt hung a pouch and a black-hilted dagger in a plain black sheath. Her brown hair was cut to earlobe length. It framed a tanned face dusted with freckles across a delicate nose. Her mouth was full and decided. <br><br>The dog, known as Jump, was barrel-chested, with slightly bowed forelegs. His small, triangular eyes were set deep in a head shaped like a heavy chisel. He was mostly white, but black splotches covered the end of his nose, his lone whole ear, and his rump; his tail plainly had been broken twice. He looked like a battered foot soldier to Kel's young squire, and he had proved his combat skills often. <br><br>At the end of the hall stood a pair of wooden doors carved with a sun, the symbol of Mithros, god of law and war. They were ancient, the surfaces around the sun curved deep after centuries of polishing. Their handles were crude iron, as coarse as the fittings on a barn door. <br><br>Kel stopped. Of the pages who had just passed the great examinations to become squires, she was the only one who had not come here before. Pages never came to this hall. Legend held that pages who visited the Chapel of the Ordeal never became squires: they were disgraced or killed. But once they were squires, the temptation to see the place where they would be tested on their fitness for knighthood was irresistible. <br><br>Kel reached for the handle, and opened one door just enough to admit her and Jump. There were benches placed on either side of the room from the door to the altar. Kel slid onto one, glad to give her wobbly knees a rest. Jump sat in the aisle beside her. <br><br>After her heart calmed, Kel inspected her surroundings. This chapel, focus of so many longings, was plain. The floor was gray stone flags; the benches were polished wood without ornament. Windows set high in the walls on either side were as stark as the room itself. <br><br>Ahead was the altar. Here, at least, was decoration: gold candlesticks and an altar cloth that looked like gold chain mail. The sun disk on the wall behind it was also gold. Against the gray stone, the dark benches, and the wrought-iron cressets on the walls, the gold looked tawdry. <br><br>The iron door to the right of the sun disk drew Kel's eyes. There was the Chamber of the Ordeal. Generations of squires had entered it to experience something. None told what they saw; they were forbidden to speak of it. Whatever it was, it usually let squires return to the chapel to be knighted. <br><br>Some who entered the Chamber failed. A year-mate of Kel's brother Anders had died three weeks after his Ordeal without ever speaking. Two years after that a squire from Fief Yanholm left the Chamber, refused his shield, and fled, never to be seen again. At Midwinter in 453, months before the Immortals War broke out, a squire went mad there. Five months later he escaped his family and drowned himself <br><br>&#8221;The Chamber is like a cutter of gemstones,&quot; Anders had told Kel once. &quot;It looks for your flaws and hammers them, till you crack open. And that's all I-or anyone will say about it.&quot; <br><br>The iron door seemed almost separate from the wall, more real than its surroundings. Kel got to her feet, hesitated, then went to it. Standing before the door, she felt a cold draft. <br><br>Kel wet suddenly dry lips with her tongue. Jump whined. &quot;I know what I'm doing,&#8221; she told her dog without conviction, and set her palm on the door. <br><br><i>She sat at a desk, stacks of Parchment on either side. Her hands sharpened a goose quill with a penknife. Splotches of ink stained her fingers. Even her sleeves were spotted with &quot;There you are, squire.&quot; <br><br>Kel looked up. Before her stood Sir Gareth the Younger, King <br>Jonathan's friend and adviser. Like Kel's, his hands and sleeves were ink-stained. &#8220;I need you to find these.&#8221; He passed a slate to Kel, who took it, her throat tight with misery. &quot;Before you finish up today, please. They should be in section eighty-eight.&quot; He pointed to the far end of the room. She saw shelves, all stretching from floor to ceiling, al lstuffed with books, scrolls, and documents. <br><br>She looked at her tunic. She wore the badge Fief Naxen, Sir Gareth's home, with the white ring around it that indicated she served the heir to the fief. Her knight-master was a desk knight, not a warrior. <br><br>Work is work, she thought, trying not to cry. She still had her duty to Sir Gareth, even if  it meant grubbing through papers. She thrust herself away ftom her desk-<br><br></i>-and tottered on the chapel's flagstones. Her hands were numb with cold, her palms bright red where they had touched the Chamber door. <br><br>Kel scowled at the iron door. &quot;I'll do my duty,&quot; she told the thing, shivering. <br><br>Jump whined again. He peered up at her, his tail awag in consolation. <br><br>&quot;I'm all right,&quot; Kel reassured him, but she checked her hands for inkspots. The Chamber had made her live the thing she feared most just now, when no field knight had asked for her service. What if the Chamber knew? What if she was to spend the next four years copying out dry passages from drier records? Would she quit? Would paperwork do what other pages' hostility had not-drive her back to Mindelan?",

        "PAGE KELADRY<br><br>Fall that year was warm. Heat lay in a blanket over the basin of the River Olorun, where the capital of Tortall covered the banks. No breath of air stirred the pennants and flags on their poles. The river itself was a band of glass, without a breeze anywhere to ruffle its shinning surface. Traffic in the city moved as if the air were thick honey No one with sense cared to rush. <br><br>Behind the royal palace, eleven-year-old Keladry of Mindelan stared at the rising ground that led from the training yards to the pages' wing and decided that she had no sense. She felt as if she'd let people beat her with mallets all morning. Surely it was too hot for her to do as she normally did -run up that hill to reach her rooms and bathe. After all, she would be the only one to know if she walked today. <br><br>Who would think this cursed harness would make such a difference? she wondered, reaching under her canvas practice coat to finger broad leather straps. At some point during her first year as page, she had learned that second-, third-, and fourth-years wore weighted- harnesses, and that more weights were -added every four months, but she had never considered it in terms of herself Now she wished that she had donned something of the kind in the empty summer months, when she made the daily trek to the palace to keep up her training. If she had, she wouldn&#8217;t ache so much now. <br><br>She wiped her sleeve over her forehead. It's not even like you're carrying a lot - of weight, she scolded herself. Eight little disks- maybe two pounds in lead. You trained last year and all summer with lead-weighted weapons, just to build your strength. <i>This</i> can&#8217;t be that different! <br><br>But it was. Hand-to-hand combat, staff work, archery, and riding took extra effort with two pounds of lead hanging on her shoulders, chest, and back. I've got to run, she told herself wearily. If I don&#8217;t move soon, I'll be late to wash and late to lunch, and Lord Wy1don will give me punishment work. So heat or no, I have to go up that hill. I may as well run it. <br><br>She waited a moment more, steeling herself. She hated this run. That slowly rising ground was torture on her legs even last spring, when she'd been running it off and on for more than half a year. <br><br>No stranger, looking at her, would have thought this disheveled girl was the sort to cause a storm of argument at court. She had a dreamer's quiet hazel eyes, framed in long lashes, and plain brown hair that she wore cropped as short as a boy's. Her nose was small and delicate, her skin tan and dusted with freckles. She was big for a girl of eleven, five feet three inches tall and solidly built. Only someone who looked closely at her calm face would detect a spark in her level gaze, and determination in her mouth and chin. <br><br>At last she groaned and began to trot up the hill. Her path took her behind the mews, the kennels, and the forges. Men and women in palace livery and servants' garb waved as she ran past. A woman told some kennel workers, &quot;Looka here- tol' ya she'd be back!&quot; <br><br>Kel smiled through pouring sweat. No one had thought that the old-fashioned training master would allow the first-known girl page in over a century to stay after her first year. When Lord WyIdon surprised the world and allowed Kel to stay, many had assumed Kel would &quot;come to her senses&quot; and drop out over the summer holiday. <br><br>You&#8217;d think by now they'd know I won't quit, she thought as she toiled on up the hill. <br><br>She was lurching when she reached the kitchen gardens, her shortcut to the pages' wing. There she had to catch her breath. An upended bucket did for a seat. She inhaled the scents of marjoram, sage, and thyme, massaging her calf muscles. For the hundredth time she wished she could use the palace baths as the boys did, instead of having to go all the way to her room to wash up. <br><br>&quot;Hi! You!&quot; cried a male voice from the direction -of the kitchens. &quot;Come back with those sausages!&quot; <br><br>Kel got to her feet. A cook raced out of the kitchen, waving a meat cleaver. Empty beanpoles, stripped after the harvest, went flying as he crashed through them. Metal flashed as the cleaver chopped through the air. The man doubled back and ran on, plainly chasing something far smaller than he. Once he stumbled; once he dropped the cleaver. On he came, cursing. <br><br>The dog he pursued raced toward Kel. A string of fat sausages hung from his jaws. With a last burst of speed, the animal ducked behind Kel. <br><br>The cook charged them, cleaver raised. &quot;I'll kill YOU this time!&quot; he screeched, face crimson with fury. <br><br>Kel put her hands on her hips. &quot;Me or the dog?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Out of the way, page!&quot; he snarled, circling to her left. &quot;He's stolen his last meal!&quot; <br><br>As she turned to keep herself between the man and his prey, Kel glanced behind her. The dog huddled by her seat, gobbling his catch. <br><br>&quot;Stop right there,&quot; Kel ordered the man. <br><br>&quot;Move, or I'll report this to my lord Wyldon,&quot; he snapped. &quot;I'll get that mongrel good and proper!&quot; <br><br>Kel gathered dog and sausages up in her arms. &quot;You1l do no such thing,&quot; she retorted. The dog, knowing what was important, continued to gorge. <br><br>&quot;You'll hand that animal over now, my lad, if you know what's right,&#8221; the servant told her. &quot;He's naught but a thieving stray. He's got to be stopped.&quot; <br><br>&quot;With a meat cleaver?&quot; demanded Kel. <br><br>&quot;If that's what it takes.&#8221;<br><br>No,&quot; she said flatly. &quot;No killing. I'll see to it the dog doesn't steal from you.&quot; <br>&quot;Sausages is worth money! Who's to pay for them? Not me!&quot; <br><br>Kel reached instinctively for her belt and sighed, impatient with herself She didn't wear her purse with training clothes. &quot;Go to Salma Aynnar, In charge of the pages' wing,&quot; she said loftily. &quot;Tell her Keladry of Mindelan requests that she pay you the cost of these sausages from my pocket money. And you'd better not overcharge her,&quot; she added. <br><br>&quot;Kel ... Oh, Mithros's&quot;- he looked at her and changed what he'd been about to say-&quot;shield. You're the girl. Being softhearted will do you no good, mistress,&quot; he informed her. &quot;Be sure I'll get my money. And if I see that animal here again&#8221; -he pointed at Kel's armful-&quot;I'll chop him up for cat-meat, see if I won't!&quot; <br><br>He thrust his cleaver into his belt and stomped back to the kitchens, muttering. Kel adjusted her hold on the dog and his prize and headed for the pages' wing. &quot;We aren&#8217;t allowed pets, you know,&quot; she informed her passenger. &quot;With my luck, all those sausages will make you sick, and I'll have to clean it up.&quot; She passed through an open door into the cool stone halls of the palace. As she trotted along, she examined her armful. <br><br>The dog's left car was only a tatter. He was gray-white for the most part; black splotches adorned the end of his nose, hi&#167;- only whole ear, and his rump. The rest of him was scars, healing scrapes, and staring ribs. His sausages eaten, he peered up into her face with two small, black, triangular eyes and licked her. His tail, broken in two places and healed crookedly, beat her arm. <br><br>&quot;I am not your friend,&quot; Kel said as she reached her door.",

      excerpt:
        "Storm Warriors<br><br>Keladry of Mindelan lay with the comfortable black blanket of sleep wrapped around her. Then, against the blackness, light moved and strengthened to show twelve large, vaguely rat- or insectlike metal creatures, devices built for murder. The killing devices were magical machines made of iron-coated giants' bones, chains, pulleys, dagger-fingers and -toes, and a long, whiplike tail. The seven-foot-tall devices stood motionless in a half circle as the light revealed what lay at their feet: a pile of dead children. <br><br>With the devices and the bodies visible, the light spread to find the man who seemed to be the master of the creations. To Keladry of Mindelan, known as Kel, he was the Nothing Man. He was almost two feet shorter than the killing devices, long-nosed and narrow-mouthed, with small, rapidly blinking eyes and dull brown hair. His dark robe was marked with stains and burns; his hair was unkempt. He always gnawed a fingernail, or scratched a pimple, or shifted from foot to foot. <br><br>Once that image-devices, bodies, man-was complete, Kel woke. She stared at the shadowed ceiling and cursed the Chamber of the Ordeal. The Chamber had shown Kel this vision, or variations of it, after her formal Ordeal of knighthood. As far as Kel knew, no one else had been given any visions of people to be found once a squire was knighted. As everyone she knew understood it, the Ordeal was straightforward enough. The Chamber forced would-be knights to live through their fears. If they did this without making a sound, they were released, to be proclaimed knights, and that was the end of the matter. <br><br>Kel was different. Three or four times a week, the Chamber sent her this dream. It was a reminder of the task it had set her. After her Ordeal, before the Chamber set her free, it had shown her the killing devices, the Nothing Man, and the dead children. It had demanded that Kel stop it all. <br><br>Kel guessed that the Nothing Man would be in Scanra, to the north, since the killing devices had appeared during Scanran raids on Tortall last summer. Trapped in the capital by a hard winter, with travel to the border nearly impossible, Kel had lived with growing tension. She had to ride north as soon as the mountain passes opened if she was to sneak into Scanra and begin her search for the Nothing Man. Every moment she remained in Tortall invited the growing risk that the king would issue orders to most knights, including Kel, to defend the northern border. The moment Kel got those orders, she would be trapped. She had vowed to defend the realm and obey its monarchs, which would mean fighting soldiers, not hunting for a mage whose location was unknown. <br><br>&quot;Maybe I'll get lucky. Maybe I'll ride out one day and find there's a line of killing devices from the palace right up to the Nothing Man's door,&quot; she grumbled, easing herself out from under her covers. Kel never threw off her blankets. With a number of sparrows and her dog sharing her bed, she might smother a friend if she hurried. Even taking care, she heard muffled cheeps of protest. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she told her companions, and set her feet on the cold flagstones of her floor. <br><br>She made her way across her dark room and opened the shutters on one of her windows. Before her lay a courtyard and a stable where the men of the King's Own kept their horses. The torches that lit the courtyard were nearly out. The pearly radiance that came to the eastern sky in the hour before dawn fell over snow, stable, and the edges of the palace wall beyond. <br><br>The scant light showed a big girl of eighteen, broadshouldered and solid-waisted, with straight mouse-brown hair cut short below her earlobes and across her forehead. She had a dreamer's hazel eyes, set beneath long, curling lashes, odd in contrast to the many fine scars on her hands and the muscles that flexed and bunched under her nightshirt. Her nose was still unbroken and delicate after eight years of palace combat training, her lips full and quicker to smile than frown. Determination filled every inch of her strong body. <br><br>Motion in the shadows at the base of the courtyard wall caught her eye. Kel gasped as a winged creature waddled out into the open courtyard, as ungainly on its feet as a vulture. The flickering torchlight caught and sparked along the edges of metal feathers on wings and legs. Steel legs, flexible and limber, ended in steel-clawed feet. Between the metal wings and above the metal legs and feet was human flesh, naked, hairless, grimy, and in this case, male. <br><br>The Stormwing looked at Kel and grinned, baring sharp steel teeth. His face was lumpy and unattractive, marked by a large nose, small eyes, and a thin upper lip with a full lower one. He had the taunting smile of someone born impudent. &quot;Startle you, did I?&#8221; he inquired. <br><br>Kel thanked the gods that the cold protected her sensitive nose, banishing most of the Stormwing's foul stench. Stormwings loved battlefields, where they tore corpses to pieces, urinated on them, smeared them with dung, then rolled in the mess. The result was a nauseating odor that made even the strongest stomach rebel. Her teachers had explained that the purpose of Stormwings was to make people think twice before they chose to fight, knowing what might happen to the dead when Stormwings arrived. So far they hadn't done much good as far as Kel could see: people still fought battles and killed each other, Stormwings or no. Tortall&#8217;s Stormwing population was thriving. But this was the first time she'd seen one on palace grounds. <br><br>Kel glared at him. <br>&#8220;Get out of here, you nasty thing! Shoo!&#8221; <br><br>&quot;Is that any way to greet a future companion?&quot; demanded the Stormwing, raising thin brown brows.",

      excerpt:
        "CHAPTER ONE<br><br><br> The Last Unicorn<br> &#160;<br> The November sky was gray with clouds. Jack sat reading in front of the living room fire.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Who wants hot chocolate?&rdquo; his dad called from the kitchen.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Me, please!&rdquo; said Jack.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> The front door burst open, and with a gust of cold wind, Annie rushed inside. &ldquo;Jack! Guess what!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s back!&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; said Jack.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;I was walking home from the library&rdquo;&mdash; Annie paused to catch her breath&mdash;&ldquo;and I saw a flash in the sky above the woods. The last time that happened&mdash;&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> Before she could finish the sentence, Jack jumped up. &ldquo;Dad, Annie and I are going to go outside for a while!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Can the hot chocolate wait till we get back?&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Sure, have fun!&rdquo; their dad called from the kitchen.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;I have to get my pack,&rdquo; Jack said to Annie. &ldquo;Meet you on the porch.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the rhyme book!&rdquo; said Annie.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> Annie slipped outside and Jack ran up to his room. He grabbed his backpack. He checked to make sure their book of magic rhymes was inside. <i>Good</i>, there it was.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> Jack charged back downstairs. He pulled on his boots, put on his jacket, tied a scarf around his neck, grabbed his mittens, and headed out the door.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; said Annie.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> Jack could see his breath in the cold air. &ldquo;Brrr,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry!&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> Jack and Annie ran down the street and into the Frog Creek woods. They wove between the trees, their boots crunching through the fallen leaves.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> Jack stopped. The magic tree house was back. High in a tall oak tree, it was silhouetted against the gray November sky. &ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; he said to Annie. &ldquo;Good work.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Annie said. She ran to the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed her.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> When they climbed inside the tree house, Jack and Annie saw a book and a scroll of parchment paper lying on the floor. Annie picked up the scroll, unrolled it, and read aloud.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> <i>Dear Jack and Annie of Frog Creek,</i><br> <i>I am sending you on one more mission to prove that you can use magic wisely. This poem will guide you.</i><br> <i>&mdash;M.</i><br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> <i>The very last unicorn </i><br><i> Is now hidden well</i><br><i> By those who have put him </i><br><i> Under a spell.</i><br> &#160;<br><i> Four centuries, four decades </i><br><i> From that afternoon,</i><br><i> At the end of November, </i><br><i> Before the blue moon,</i><br> &#160;<br><i> He will wake once more </i><br><i> And be free to go home </i><br><i> If you call out his name: </i><br><i> Divine Flower of Rome.</i><br> &#160;<br><i> You must coax him to stand </i><br><i> Once his name is spoken.</i><br><i> His chain will break</i><br><i> And the spell, too, be broken.</i><br> &#160;<br><i> Then a young girl must love him </i><br><i> And show him the way,</i><br><i> Lest he be trapped forever </i><br><i> On public display.</i><br> &#160;<br><i> If he loses this chance </i><br><i> To rise and depart, </i><br><i> All magic will fade</i><br><i> From his horn and his heart.</i><br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;A unicorn!&rdquo; breathed Annie. &ldquo;I love him already. <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> show him the way!&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;But this poem is really hard to understand,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;What kind of research book did Morgan send us?&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> He picked up the book that had been left for them by Morgan le Fay, the librarian of Camelot. The cover showed a row of skyscrapers. The title was <i>New York City Guide Book, 1938</i>.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;New York City?&rdquo; said Annie. &ldquo;I love New York City! Remember the great time we had there with Aunt Mallory?&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Yeah, I love it, too,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;But why would there be a unicorn in New York City in 1938? A unicorn is an ancient fantasy creature. New York City&rsquo;s a real place, and 1938 is not even that long ago.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Annie. &ldquo;It sounds like a hard mission. But don&rsquo;t forget we have Teddy and Kathleen&rsquo;s magic rhymes to help us.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; said Jack. He pulled out the book given to them by their friends Teddy and Kathleen, two young enchanters of Camelot. &ldquo;The problem is, we can only use each rhyme once, and we&rsquo;ve already used seven out of the ten.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Which means we still have three left,&rdquo; said Annie. &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;<i>Pull a Cloud from the Sky</i>,&rdquo; said Jack. <br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; said Annie.<br> &ldquo;Yeah, it is,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not sure it will be much use.&rdquo; He looked back at the book. &ldquo;<i>Find a Treasure You Must Never Lose</i>,&rdquo; he said. <br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s a really good one!&rdquo; said Annie. &ldquo;The unicorn&rsquo;s a treasure. So that rhyme could<br> take care of our whole mission.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;But it only partly fits,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You could call the unicorn a treasure. But once we find him, we have to lose him. He has to go back home.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Oh, right... ,&rdquo; said Annie. &ldquo;What else?&rdquo; <br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Your favorite,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;<i>Turn into Ducks</i>.&rdquo; <br> &#160;<br> Annie laughed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to use that one!&rdquo; she said.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;I hope we <i>never</i> use that one,&rdquo; said Jack. He didn&rsquo;t want to waddle around and quack like a duck. &ldquo;These leftover rhymes don&rsquo;t seem very helpful to me.&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s just wait and see,&rdquo; said Annie. &ldquo;But now . . . &rdquo; She held up Morgan&rsquo;s research book and smiled.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> Jack nodded. &ldquo;New York City, here we come,&rdquo; he said. He pointed at the book&rsquo;s cover. &ldquo;I wish we could go <i>there</i>!&rdquo;<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> The wind started to blow.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> The tree house started to spin. It spun faster and faster.<br> &#160;<br> &#160;<br> Then everything was still. Absolutely still.",

      excerpt:
        "CHAPTER ONE<br><br><br>BRIGHT MATERIALS<br><br><br>The secret of science, and <br>all the stars that shine<br><br><br>''She walks in beauty, like the night<br>Of cloudless climes and starry skies;<br>And all that's best of dark and bright<br>Meet in her aspect and her eyes:<br>Thus mellowed to that tender light<br>Which heaven to gaudy day denies.''<br>LORD BYRON<br><br><br><br><br>...her knowledge was patchy. She knew about atoms and <br>elementary particles, and anbaromagnetic charges and the four fundamental forces and other bits and pieces of experimental theology, but nothing about the solar system. In fact, when Mrs. Coulter realized this and explained how the earth and the other five planets revolved around the sun, Lyra laughed loudly at the joke.<br>However, she was keen to show that she did know some things, and when Mrs. Coulter was telling her about electrons, she said expertly, &quot;Yes, they're negatively charged particles. Sort of like Dust, except that Dust isn't charged.&quot;<br>Science is explainable magic. If you were a time traveler visiting our world from the ancient past, you would think that magic was everywhere around you. Planes flying, cars moving, even frozen food would seem strange and miraculous. They are not strange magic to us because we are used to them and because we know they work by science, not magic. In ancient times, people were amazed and awed by things like rainbows and eclipses, things they had no control over. We still can't control these things, but we aren't scared of them, because we understand the science behind them.<br>In Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy, when Lyra visits Will's world, things like cars seem magical to her. And in Lyra's world there are things, like the alethiometer, and Dust, that seem like magic to Will. But even these things are really based on science. We are going to tell you about that science, the science of His Dark Materials. The story is all about uncovering hidden truth. The truly big magic that Philip Pullman weaves into his story is the magic that understanding things and knowing how the world works makes it less scary. He shows us that knowledge and science put you more in control of things.<br>This means more than understanding how a frozen pizza is made. Understanding frozen pizza is pretty smart, but the understanding behind His Dark Materials involves the whole Universe. That's where the &quot;Dark Materials&quot; come from. We're not talking here about the kind of material used to make a shirt or a curtain, but much more mysterious stuff, a kind of invisible matter that fills the Universe.<br>The worlds inhabited by Lyra, Will, and the other characters are embedded in a sea of Dust, which falls on them from space, and is real, but cannot be seen by human eyes. The characters, especially Lyra and Will, are also surrounded by a sea of knowledge. There is information about the world that they know nothing about when the story begins, but that they learn about, with the help of the alethiometer, as their adventure unfolds.<br>Both these images are true. Knowledge really does make the world a better place to live in. And astronomers really do have evidence that there is about ten times as much dark stuff in our Universe as there are bright stars and galaxies. Just like Dust, this dark material is not like anything ever detected on Earth. It isn't made of the kind of atoms and molecules your body is made of, or the air you breathe, or anything you have ever touched or seen. But, like Lyra, we have to know about things like atoms and electrons before we can learn about the dark materials in the Universe. And, unlike Lyra, we know a great deal about what goes on in space--not just in our Solar System, where there are actually nine planets, not six, but in the stars and galaxies beyond the planets.<br>THE STUFF OF THE UNIVERSE<br>What are atoms? Atoms are tiny particles that move around all the time, bouncing off one another and sometimes sticking together to make molecules. The discovery of atoms is the most important discovery in the whole of science. There are approximately two and a half centimeters in one inch, and an atom is only about one hundred-millionth of a centimeter across, so it would take ten million atoms side by side to stretch across the gap between two of the &quot;teeth&quot; on the jagged edge of a postage stamp. The oxygen molecules that you breathe in to stay alive are made of two oxygen atoms joined together. They don't just waft around gently in the air waiting for you to come along and breathe them in. When it comes to speed, they can go 50 times faster than the fastest 100-yard sprinter, and they never stop for a rest.<br>Oxygen molecules in the air move at about one-third of a mile per second. If they went in a straight line, they could cover more than 18 miles in a minute. But they never get a chance to go far, because they are always bouncing off other molecules in the air. The average distance they travel between collisions is just five millionths of an inch. They are so close together that they collide with other molecules three and a half billion times every second. That makes 210 billion collisions every minute. Feel free to work out how many that is in a day, a week, a century....<br>Atoms come in different varieties, corresponding to different kinds of material called elements. There are 92 different elements (things like oxygen, gold, or the silicon used in computer chips) that occur naturally on Earth. Because each variety of element corresponds to a different variety of atom, this means there are 92 different kinds of atoms. Everything we experience in our everyday lives is thanks to these 92 kinds of atoms interacting with each other in different ways. All the stuff around you, everywhere in the Universe, that is made of atoms is called baryonic matter.<br>THE LIGHT THAT SHINES<br>When atoms get hot, they radiate energy in the form of light--they shine. The white light that surrounds you in daylight is made of all the colors of the rainbow mixed together. In a rainbow, the colors are spread out to make a spectrum. You can do the same thing by shining light through a triangle of glass, called a prism, to make a spectrum. If you hang a prism in a window on a sunny day, it makes rainbow patterns that dance on the walls. The rainbow pattern is made because the light gets bent when it goes through the prism. Different colors are bent by slightly different amounts, so the colors get spread out. The same thing happens in raindrops to make rainbows. Raindrops are like tiny prisms.<br>One of the great discoveries of science in the nineteenth century was that each kind of atom shines in a particular way, making its own contribution to the rainbow spectrum of light. This role of the atom is an example of a hidden truth.<br>All the colors of the rainbow are made by light from shining atoms. Sodium atoms shine very brightly with yellow light. Sodium atoms in the gas in streetlights get their energy from electricity and turn it into yellow light. Every time you see that sort of yellow light, you know sodium is there, even if you can't touch it. If you ever see someone throw ordinary salt into a fire, you see a flash of the same &quot;street lamp&quot; yellow light. That is because salt molecules are made of sodium atoms joined to chlorine atoms (the chemical name for salt is sodium chloride).<br>BEYOND THE RAINBOW<br>On Earth, chemists can study the light from every kind of atom and measure the exact color it contributes to the spectrum. A little piece of magic turned into science. Astronomers can take this magic out into space. They measure the strength of light of different colors coming from the Sun and the stars, so they can work out what the stars are made of without ever going into space. That would have seemed like magic even a couple of hundred years ago. We actually know what the stars are made of, even though they are so far away that the light from them takes hundreds or thousands of years to get to us.<br>The scientific magic of the spectrum shows that all the stars--everything we can see in the Universe--are made of the same kind of atoms that we are made of. It is all baryonic matter.<br>STARS LIKE DUST<br>The Sun looks big and bright to us, and we see it in daylight, not at night. But it is an ordinary star. It is about 109 times bigger across than the Earth is and contains about 330,000 times as much material as the Earth does. It shines because, deep inside the Sun, one kind of atom (hydrogen) is being turned into another kind of atom (helium). This process is called nuclear fusion. When light atoms fuse together, they release energy. All stars shine in the same way.<br>The Sun looks very bright to us because it is quite close, in cosmic terms. The Earth orbits around the Sun once every year, at a distance of about 93 million miles. That's very nearly 400 times farther away from us than the Moon. But it's just next door in the Cosmos.<br>Other stars are just as bright as the Sun. Some of them are even brighter. But even extra-bright stars look faint to us because they are so far away. If you stood near a huge bonfire, it would look big and bright. But if you stood on a hill a few miles away and looked down on the bonfire, it would look like a tiny flickering flame. It's the same with stars, but the distances are much more than a few miles. Even stars that are quite close to us by cosmic standards are hundreds of thousands of times farther away than the Sun. And there are thousands and thousands of stars so far away that they are too faint to see at all without a telescope.<br>On a dark, moonless night, far from the city lights, you can see a white band of light across the sky. This is called the Milky Way. Telescopes show that the Milky Way is made up of millions and millions of stars, like a band of white dust scattered across the sky. The Sun is one of the stars of the Milky Way Galaxy. This Milky Way Galaxy is a disk of stars, shaped a bit like a huge fried egg, so big that it would take a beam of light 100,000 years to travel from one side to the other, even though light travels at 186,000 miles a second, or six trillion miles in a year. This huge distance is called a light- year. If you were as near to one of these stars as we are to the Sun, it would look as big and bright as the Sun. There are hundreds of billions of stars like the Sun in the Milky Way Galaxy.<br>UNIVERSES BEYOND THE UNIVERSE<br>But this is not the end of the story. Until the 1920s, astronomers thought that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire Universe, everything that there is. That's less than 100 years ago. Since then, bigger and better telescopes have made it possible to look farther and farther into the Cosmos. Astronomers found that there are other galaxies, like islands in the sea of space, beyond the Milky Way. In a way, they are like other universes. But they are not the kind of other universes that Philip Pullman writes about.<br>The light from these galaxies tells us that they are made of ordinary stars and ordinary atoms just like the ones on Earth and in the Sun. Our Milky Way is an average-sized galaxy. Beyond the Milky Way, the Cosmos contains hundreds of billions of galaxies, each containing hundreds of billions of stars. All this bright stuff, in every star in every galaxy, is baryonic matter--it is all made of atoms. Galaxies so far away that the light we see from them left their stars even before the time of the dinosaurs here on Earth are all made of baryonic matter, just like the matter you are made of and everything you touch is made of.<br>All this is our kind of magic; the scientific magic of the world we live in. Philip Pullman's &quot;Dark Materials&quot; might seem like a different kind of magic, pure fantasy that he has invented to make a good story. The amazing thing is, though, that these Dark Materials are also part of the scientific magic of our own world. This is such an amazing story that it deserves a chapter to itself.<br> CHAPTER TWO<br><br><br>DARK MATERIALS<br><br><br>THE HIDDEN WORLD, AND<br>THE NATURE OF DUST<br><br><br>''There are more things in heaven and <br>earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of <br>in your philosophy.''<br>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE<br><br><br><br><br>&quot;Dark matter is what my research team is looking for. No one knows what it is. There's more stuff out there in the universe than we can see, that's the point. We can see the stars and the galaxies and the things that shine, but for it all to hang together and not fly apart, there needs to be a lot more of it--to make gravity work, you see. But no one can detect it. So there are lots of different research projects trying to find out what it is, and this is one of them.&quot;<br><br><br>As Mary Malone explains to Lyra, there's more to the Universe than meets the eye. At one level, the Dark Materials are Dust--something that can't be seen but is really there, in Lyra's world as well as in our own. But this is also a metaphor for another kind of dark material--hidden knowledge, and hidden forces, like Mrs. Coulter and the General Oblation Board carrying out their plans in secret. And even they don't know what is really going on at a deeper level still. It's like those sets of Russian dolls with one doll inside another, inside another, and so on, right down to a tiny little doll in the middle.<br>Our Universe is a bit like that. When astronomers started looking at the sky and studying stars and galaxies with their telescopes, they thought that all this bright stuff was all that really mattered. But in the second half of the twentieth century, less than 50 years ago, they found out that they were wrong. They found out that there is ten times more dark matter in the Universe than all the bright stuff put together.<br>It's like an iceberg. When you see an iceberg floating in the sea, it looks big and white and shiny. But there is actually ten times as much ice underneath the water, hidden in the dark, where you can't see it. This is the idea behind Dust--the Dark Materials of the story. But if you can't see the dark stuff, how do astronomers know that it is there?",

      excerpt:
        'Andrew Dubble, smaller than a speck of dust, flopped onto his uncle Al\'s wrist.<br><br>Andrew, his pocket-sized robot friend Thudd, and his thirteen-year-old cousin Judy had just been plucked from an Australian river by their uncle Al. He had come looking for them with a rowboat and a powerful searchlight.<br><br>Wowzers schnauzers! thought Andrew, bouncing on Uncle Al\'s skin. We\'re too small to see! And it\'s nighttime, too.<br><br>During their trip down the river, a shock from an electrical fish had shrunk them from the size of beetles to the size of bacteria.<br><br>When Uncle Al had opened their vehicle, the shiny, round Umbubble, they had tumbled out of it.<br><br>Ga-nuff . . . ga-nuff . . . ga-newww . . . Judy snored.<br><br>The shock that had made them small had also made Judy snooze.<br><br>With one hand, Andrew clutched the collar of Judy\'s jacket to keep her from falling off Uncle Al\'s wrist and into the river. With his other hand, he clung to one of Uncle Al\'s hairs.<br><br>Uncle Al shined his searchlight on the river.<br><br>Andrew looked up at Uncle Al. It was like looking up at the gigantic head of one of the presidents carved into Mount Rushmore.<br><br>Uncle Al\'s bushy eyebrows came together like two gigantic caterpillars. His frowning eyes scanned the dark ripples around his boat. "I wonder if they fell out when I opened the Umbubble," he said to himself.<br><br>"Uncle Al!" cried Andrew.<br><br>But Andrew\'s voice was much too small for Uncle Al to hear.<br><br>meep . . . "Purple-button time!" came a squeaky voice from Andrew\'s pocket. It was Thudd, Andrew\'s little silver robot and best friend.<br><br>In the middle of Thudd\'s chest were three rows of buttons with three buttons in each row. All of the buttons blinked green except for the big purple one in the middle. Pressing this button was the way Andrew, Judy, and Thudd could reach Uncle Al in an emergency.<br><br>Thudd pressed his purple button. It blinked three times and went off.<br><br>Nyeeeeeeeee . . . <br><br>The sound was close by. What\'s that? wondered Andrew.<br><br>Nyeeeeeeeee . . . <br><br>The sound kept getting louder.<br><br>NYEEEEEEEEEE . . . <br><br>The whining was so close and so loud that it hurt Andrew\'s tiny ears.<br><br>By the glare of the searchlight, Andrew made out something strange just above his head. It looked like a giant, hairy flower bud attached to a long, hairy stem. Andrew\'s eyes followed the stem up.<br><br>Way above, he glimpsed what was at the end of the stem--a horrible head!<br><br>"Yowzers!" he whispered. Two black eyes covered most of the head like a helmet. <br><br>Long, hairy antennas stuck out from under the eyes.<br><br>Eek! "Mosquito!" squeaked Thudd.<br><br>Suddenly the hairy bud snapped open and slammed down over Andrew and Judy!<br><br>Eek! squeaked Thudd. "Mosquito snout! Called proboscis."<br><br>Inside the darkness of the mosquito snout, Andrew and Judy were squashed between two walls. Andrew couldn\'t move. He tried to push the walls.<br><br>"Youch!" he said. The walls had razor-sharp edges, like blades.<br><br>The snout began to shove Andrew and Judy along Uncle Al\'s skin.<br><br>Eek! squeaked Thudd. "Mosquito look for good place to bite! Look for tiny blood tube called capillary. Near top of skin."<br><br>"What if Uncle Al swats the mosquito?" asked Andrew. "He\'ll crush us, too."<br><br>meep . . . "Mosquito light, light, light!" said Thudd. "Human not feel anything yet."<br><br>Ga-nufff . . . ga-nufff . . . ga-newww . . . snored Judy. She squirmed as though she were having a bad dream.<br><br>"Androoooo?" she said sleepily.<br><br>"Jeepers creepers!" said Andrew. "You\'ve been asleep for a long time!"<br><br>Judy rubbed her eyes. "Where are we?" she asked. "Where\'s Uncle Al?"<br><br>"Um," Andrew began. But just then, the blades inside the snout started sawing into Uncle Al\'s skin!<br><br>Andrew sniffed a coppery smell. Blood! he thought.<br><br>Eek! "Mosquito snout gonna push Drewd and Oody inside Uncle Al!" squeaked Thudd. "Drewd got Schnozzle?"<br><br>Andrew shoved a hand into one of his pants pockets. He quickly pulled out two pairs of black goggles with noses attached and mustaches underneath.
